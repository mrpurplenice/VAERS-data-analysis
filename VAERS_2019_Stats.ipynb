              "2402   This is a spontaneous case, initially received from other non-health professional on 09-Jan-2019 (processed together with follow-up received on 10-Jan-2019), concerning a 38-year-old, adult, female patient. The patient had no historical or current condition. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. On 21-Dec-2018, the patient was administered FLUCELVAX QIVc (influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell-culture-derived, dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration: intramuscular, anatomical location: deltoid, batch number: 252685 and expiry date: 30-Jun-2019) for influenza prophylaxis. On 05-Jan-2019, 15 days after vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. On the same day, the patient was hospitaliszd. At the time of this report, the patient was in intensive care unit (ICU) and was diagnosed with fulminant myocarditis. The reporter was concerned about the quality of the product the patient was given (explicitly coded as suspected product quality issue). The patient had not recovered from the events. The reporter assessed the case as serious (hospitalization).; Reporter's Comments: A 38-year-old, female patient was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza, 15 days after administration of FLUCELVAX QIV followed by fulminant myocarditis. Considering the implausible temporal relationship, the event of H1N1 influenza was assessed as not related to suspect vaccine as vaccination usually requires minimum 2-3 weeks to provide immune protection against influenza. Despite temporal association between vaccination and event of fulminant myocarditis, the clinical course suggests the reported H1N1 influenza as a more plausible explanation for the event. Hence, the company assessed the causality as not related to suspect vaccine. There is lack of information with respect to nature/cause of the reported event of suspected product quality issue and the company assessed the event as unassessable. The case will be further assessed upon receipt of follow up information. The company assessed the case as serious (medically significant).  \n",

She was well appearing with normal growth. Within 24 hours developed, lethargy, diarrhea, poor feeding and presented to the ED the next day with profound metabolic acidosis. She was intubated and admitted to PICU where she was diagnosed with a severe dilated cardiomyopathy. She remained intubated and on high levels of inotropic support for the first 1-2 weeks and then gradually improved. A very extensive workup was done. At time of discharge there was no identifiable etiology for what was a presumed acute and very fulminant myocarditis including extensive metabolic, genetic, and infectious etiologies. She has continued to improve over the last 10 months and is entirely normal developmentally at this time. She is currently being very slowly weaned off all cardiac medications. Her most recent echo is normal. She remains on carnitine supplementation which was started the PICU after she was found to have minimally reduced levels (medical genetics did not feel this was the etiology). Awaiting input to d/c that from genetics. She has not received further vaccinations since her two month shots.  \n",

Initially seen in the ED at Medical Center on 03/29/2019, had normal EKG, normal labs including troponin, CBC, CMP, and was discharged home. Continued to have symptoms, and was sent to the ED again from his clinic on 04/02/2019 as he had reported a fever orally of 101F on the evening of 04/01/2019. EKG, CBC, CMP again unremarkable; however troponin was elevated at 1.87.

A patient with unknown demographics experienced myocarditis, chest pain and blister on the vaccination site following the administration of ACAM2000 (Smallpox (Vaccinia) vaccine, Live).  Seven days ago (24MAY2019) the patient received smallpox vaccine (lot, dose and route unknown). Patient was hospitalized for myocarditis and presented with chest pain, local reaction or blister on the vaccine site but no fever. Outcome at the time of report was unknown.  The reporting physician was not involved in the care of the patient and was consulted by a provider from another healthcare facility to determine whether the patient needs any isolation precautions from infection control standpoint. The reporting physician did not have any other patient details.  Medical History/ Allergies: Not reported  Concomitant medication: Not reported.  Company Medical Assessment:  The Company considers that the diagnosis of myocarditis was possible related to ACAM2000. Despite the information is limited, it is assumed that the diagnosis made at the hospital is correct. In primary vaccinees, the onset of myocarditis associated with chest pain is within 4-15 days after vaccination, the patient was vaccinated seven days prior. The vaccination site reaction appears to be a satellite lesion, which is also a common complication of vaccination. More information has been requested.  \n",

A 24 years old male patient presented with a reaction from ACAM2000. He experienced myocarditis, pericarditis and localized reaction at the site of vaccination following the administration of ACAM2000 (smallpox vaccine).  Ten days ago on an unknown date (??-MAY-2019), the patient was administered ACAM2000 (lot, dose and route unknown) in the right arm.  The patient was transferred from an unknown emergency room to their emergency room for a higher level of care. The patient had a localized reaction at the site of administration, developed myocarditis and pericarditis. On 31MAY2019, an electrocardiogram(EKG) showed pericarditis and patient was hospitalized. MRI result was still pending. He was treated with colchicine and ibuprofen orally with events improving. The patient was still in hospital at the time of the report.  Medical history: None reported.  There was no known allergies.  The event was considered to be serious (life threatening, hospitalization).  Company Medical Assessment:  The Company considered that there was temporal relationship to ACAM2000 vaccination and because myocarditis and pericarditis are known complication phenomenon of ACAM2000. Because there is not enough information, the Company assessed these events as \"suspected\" or possible related. The vaccination reaction is considered \"definitely\" related as it is a common mild vaccination and local complication. The Company does not consider that the AEs were \"Life threatened\" as they do not meet the seriousness criterion of Life threatening.    It appears that this case is the same case as 19000138SP. The company is waiting for more information.  \n",

The patient had no historical or current condition. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. On 21-Dec-2018, the patient was administered FLUCELVAX QIVc (influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell-culture-derived, dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration: intramuscular, anatomical location: deltoid, batch number: 252685 and expiry date: 30-Jun-2019) for influenza prophylaxis. On 05-Jan-2019, 15 days after vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. On the same day, the patient was hospitaliszd. At the time of this report, the patient was in intensive care unit (ICU) and was diagnosed with fulminant myocarditis. The reporter was concerned about the quality of the product the patient was given (explicitly coded as suspected product quality issue). The patient had not recovered from the events. The reporter assessed the case as serious (hospitalization).; Reporter's Comments: A 38-year-old, female patient was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza, 15 days after administration of FLUCELVAX QIV followed by fulminant myocarditis. Considering the implausible temporal relationship, the event of H1N1 influenza was assessed as not related to suspect vaccine as vaccination usually requires minimum 2-3 weeks to provide immune protection against influenza. Despite temporal association between vaccination and event of fulminant myocarditis, the clinical course suggests the reported H1N1 influenza as a more plausible explanation for the event. Hence, the company assessed the causality as not related to suspect vaccine. There is lack of information with respect to nature/cause of the reported event of suspected product quality issue and the company assessed the event as unassessable. The case will be further assessed upon receipt of follow up information. The company assessed the case as serious (medically significant).</td>\n",

She was intubated and admitted to PICU where she was diagnosed with a severe dilated cardiomyopathy. She remained intubated and on high levels of inotropic support for the first 1-2 weeks and then gradually improved. A very extensive workup was done. At time of discharge there was no identifiable etiology for what was a presumed acute and very fulminant myocarditis including extensive metabolic, genetic, and infectious etiologies.

Seven days ago (24MAY2019) the patient received smallpox vaccine (lot, dose and route unknown). Patient was hospitalized for myocarditis and presented with chest pain, local reaction or blister on the vaccine site but no fever. Outcome at the time of report was unknown.  The reporting physician was not involved in the care of the patient and was consulted by a provider from another healthcare facility to determine whether the patient needs any isolation precautions from infection control standpoint. The reporting physician did not have any other patient details.  Medical History/ Allergies: Not reported  Concomitant medication: Not reported.  Company Medical Assessment:  The Company considers that the diagnosis of myocarditis was possible related to ACAM2000. Despite the information is limited, it is assumed that the diagnosis made at the hospital is correct. In primary vaccinees, the onset of myocarditis associated with chest pain is within 4-15 days after vaccination, the patient was vaccinated seven days prior.

Ten days ago on an unknown date (??-MAY-2019), the patient was administered ACAM2000 (lot, dose and route unknown) in the right arm.  The patient was transferred from an unknown emergency room to their emergency room for a higher level of care. The patient had a localized reaction at the site of administration, developed myocarditis and pericarditis. On 31MAY2019, an electrocardiogram(EKG) showed pericarditis and patient was hospitalized. MRI result was still pending. He was treated with colchicine and ibuprofen orally with events improving. The patient was still in hospital at the time of the report.  Medical history: None reported.  There was no known allergies.  The event was considered to be serious (life threatening, hospitalization).  Company Medical Assessment:  The Company considered that there was temporal relationship to ACAM2000 vaccination and because myocarditis and pericarditis are known complication phenomenon of ACAM2000. Because there is not enough information, the Company assessed these events as \"suspected\" or possible related. The vaccination reaction is considered \"definitely\" related as it is a common mild vaccination and local complication. The Company does not consider that the AEs were \"Life threatened\" as they do not meet the seriousness criterion of Life threatening.    It appears that this case is the same case as 19000138SP.

Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital.\" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated.

Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital.\" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated. Patient subsequently had another occurrence of complex febrile seizures on August 20, 2017 related to strep throat. On January 4, 2018, patient passed away in his sleep.

No information regarding the patient's medical history, concomitant medications and concurrent conditions was provided.   On an unspecified date in 2000, the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23)(strength, frequency, route of administration, lot# and expiration dates were not provided) for prophylaxis. On an unknown date in 2017, he received second dose (lot # and expiry date were not provided).  On an unspecified date in 2017, the patient experienced adverse event. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding and was hospitalized, he received two units of packed red blood cells. During this stay, in 2019, the patient received his third dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23)(lot # and expiry date were not provided) and unspecified \"flu shot\". On an unspecified date in 2019, after about three weeks after being discharged from the hospital, the patient started experiencing fatigue. The patient sought medical attention and was admitted to the hospital for a second time, where he was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. The patient was given unspecified antibiotics and experienced failure of his lungs and kidneys (approximately in 2019, exact date was not provided). On an unspecified date in 2019, the patient died, after being transferred to nursing center. Cause of death was not reported. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The outcome of pneumonia bacterial, fatigue, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, renal failure and respiratory failure was reported as not recovered/not resolved. The outcome of adverse event was unknown.

Upon internal review, the events of renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia bacterial and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were determined to be medically significant.   \n",
              "75791  Foetal exposure during pregnancy; Stillbirth; Low birth weight; Premature birth; This is an observational study case, initially received from other health professional on 16-Dec-2019 with an additional information received on 18-Dec-2019 (being processed together), concerning a male, neonatal subject. The subject's mother was 33-year-old  pregnant female of body weight: 246 Ibs, height: 67 in and body mass index (BMI) 38.5 enrolled in a prospective observational safety study.  The subject's mother current medical condition included history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension (GHTN), anxiety, nausea, vomiting, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and obesity.   The subject's mother concomitant medication included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) for pregnancy, Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate) for anxiety, promethazine for nausea and vomiting and Lovenox (enoxaparin sodium) for history of venous thromboembolism.  The subject's mother had no previous pregnancies. The subject's mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCMs). The subject's mother had no history of offspring with MCM. The subject's mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The subject's mother last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2019. Estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 30-Mar-2020 and corrected estimated delivery date (CEDD) was not reported.   The type of pregnancy was singleton.    On 18-Sep-2019, the subject's mother underwent first sequential and nuchal translucency. No MCMs were noted.  On 16-Oct-2019, at approximately 16 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Afluria QIV [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell cultured derived, batch number: P100112488, dose, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as Â‘Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation.  On the same day, the subject's mother underwent second sequential and no MCMs were noted.  On 30-Oct-2019, the subject's mother underwent early glucose tolerance test and per reporter, it failed.  On 04-Nov-2019, the subject's mother underwent three-hour glucose tolerance test and no MCMs were noted.  At approximately 22 weeks of gestation, mother vaginally delivered a stillbirth male neonate, (explicitly coded as 'Premature birth'). The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The characteristics of the neonate included weight: 417 grams, head circumference and length were not reported. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were not reported. No MCMs were identified at the time of birth. On the same day, the subject's mother was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome (characterised with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count). It was reported that the factors that may had impact on fetal loss included mother's HELLP syndrome and history of DVT. It was unknown whether the autopsy was performed.  The event of stillbirth is considered as serious due to fatal outcome, while the events of low birth weight baby and premature birth are considered as serious due to criterion of medical significance.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  This case is linked to case 201907406 (corresponding mother case).  Company comment: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy may have contributed to development of the events. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related. The event foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender's Comments: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy may have contributed to development of the events. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related. The event foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related to the suspect vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Unknown cause of death   \n",

Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital.\" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated. Patient subsequently had another occurrence of complex febrile seizures on August 20, 2017 related to strep throat. On January 4, 2018, patient passed away in his sleep.

              "      <td>From hospital report-\"12 month-old previously healthy fully immunized male presents with seizures. Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital.\" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated. Patient subsequently had another occurrence of complex febrile seizures on August 20, 2017 related to strep throat. On January 4, 2018, patient passed away in his sleep.

The subject's mother was 33-year-old  pregnant female of body weight: 246 Ibs, height: 67 in and body mass index (BMI) 38.5 enrolled in a prospective observational safety study.  The subject's mother current medical condition included history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension (GHTN), anxiety, nausea, vomiting, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and obesity.   The subject's mother concomitant medication included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) for pregnancy, Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate) for anxiety, promethazine for nausea and vomiting and Lovenox (enoxaparin sodium) for history of venous thromboembolism.  The subject's mother had no previous pregnancies. The subject's mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCMs). The subject's mother had no history of offspring with MCM. The subject's mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The subject's mother last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2019. Estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 30-Mar-2020 and corrected estimated delivery date (CEDD) was not reported.   The type of pregnancy was singleton.    On 18-Sep-2019, the subject's mother underwent first sequential and nuchal translucency. No MCMs were noted.  On 16-Oct-2019, at approximately 16 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Afluria QIV [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell cultured derived, batch number: P100112488, dose, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as Â‘Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation.  On the same day, the subject's mother underwent second sequential and no MCMs were noted.  On 30-Oct-2019, the subject's mother underwent early glucose tolerance test and per reporter, it failed.  On 04-Nov-2019, the subject's mother underwent three-hour glucose tolerance test and no MCMs were noted.  At approximately 22 weeks of gestation, mother vaginally delivered a stillbirth male neonate, (explicitly coded as 'Premature birth'). The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The characteristics of the neonate included weight: 417 grams, head circumference and length were not reported. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were not reported. No MCMs were identified at the time of birth. On the same day, the subject's mother was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome (characterised with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count). It was reported that the factors that may had impact on fetal loss included mother's HELLP syndrome and history of DVT. It was unknown whether the autopsy was performed.  The event of stillbirth is considered as serious due to fatal outcome, while the events of low birth weight baby and premature birth are considered as serious due to criterion of medical significance.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  This case is linked to case 201907406 (corresponding mother case).  Company comment: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy may have contributed to development of the events. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related. The event foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender's Comments: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy may have contributed to development of the events. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related.

Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital.\" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated.

This was confirmed by the physician's assistant. My mother reported getting the PNEUMOVAX 23 vaccine at pharmacy around 12:30 p.m. on 1/9/2019. That evening at 6:25 she sent a text message saying \"my right arm is achy from my pneumonia shot and I'm getting chills. I'll go home and take Tylenol.\"  Then at 7:11 p.m. she reported \"I am lying down at home.\"  This was her last communication. The next morning she was found dead. THIS MUST BE INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY IN CASE THERE IS A BROADER ISSUE WITH THIS VACCINE LOT.  \n",

No information regarding the patient's medical history, concomitant medications and concurrent conditions was provided.   On an unspecified date in 2000, the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23)(strength, frequency, route of administration, lot# and expiration dates were not provided) for prophylaxis. On an unknown date in 2017, he received second dose (lot # and expiry date were not provided).  On an unspecified date in 2017, the patient experienced adverse event. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding and was hospitalized, he received two units of packed red blood cells. During this stay, in 2019, the patient received his third dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23)(lot # and expiry date were not provided) and unspecified \"flu shot\". On an unspecified date in 2019, after about three weeks after being discharged from the hospital, the patient started experiencing fatigue. The patient sought medical attention and was admitted to the hospital for a second time, where he was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. The patient was given unspecified antibiotics and experienced failure of his lungs and kidneys (approximately in 2019, exact date was not provided). On an unspecified date in 2019, the patient died, after being transferred to nursing center. Cause of death was not reported. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The outcome of pneumonia bacterial, fatigue, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, renal failure and respiratory failure was reported as not recovered/not resolved. The outcome of adverse event was unknown. The causality assessment between pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23) and the events was not provided.  Upon internal review, the events of renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia bacterial and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were determined to be medically significant.  \n",

The subject's mother last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2019. Estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 30-Mar-2020 and corrected estimated delivery date (CEDD) was not reported.   The type of pregnancy was singleton.    On 18-Sep-2019, the subject's mother underwent first sequential and nuchal translucency. No MCMs were noted.  On 16-Oct-2019, at approximately 16 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Afluria QIV [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell cultured derived, batch number: P100112488, dose, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as Â‘Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation.  On the same day, the subject's mother underwent second sequential and no MCMs were noted.  On 30-Oct-2019, the subject's mother underwent early glucose tolerance test and per reporter, it failed.  On 04-Nov-2019, the subject's mother underwent three-hour glucose tolerance test and no MCMs were noted.  At approximately 22 weeks of gestation, mother vaginally delivered a stillbirth male neonate, (explicitly coded as 'Premature birth'). The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The characteristics of the neonate included weight: 417 grams, head circumference and length were not reported. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were not reported. No MCMs were identified at the time of birth. On the same day, the subject's mother was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome (characterised with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count). It was reported that the factors that may had impact on fetal loss included mother's HELLP syndrome and history of DVT. It was unknown whether the autopsy was performed.  The event of stillbirth is considered as serious due to fatal outcome, while the events of low birth weight baby and premature birth are considered as serious due to criterion of medical significance.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  This case is linked to case 201907406 (corresponding mother case).  Company comment: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy may have contributed to development of the events. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related. The event foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender's Comments: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV.

Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital.\" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated. Patient subsequently had another occurrence of complex febrile seizures on August 20, 2017 related to strep throat. On January 4, 2018, patient passed away in his sleep.

No information regarding the patient's medical history, concomitant medications and concurrent conditions was provided.   On an unspecified date in 2000, the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23)(strength, frequency, route of administration, lot# and expiration dates were not provided) for prophylaxis. On an unknown date in 2017, he received second dose (lot # and expiry date were not provided).  On an unspecified date in 2017, the patient experienced adverse event. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding and was hospitalized, he received two units of packed red blood cells. During this stay, in 2019, the patient received his third dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23)(lot # and expiry date were not provided) and unspecified \"flu shot\". On an unspecified date in 2019, after about three weeks after being discharged from the hospital, the patient started experiencing fatigue. The patient sought medical attention and was admitted to the hospital for a second time, where he was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. The patient was given unspecified antibiotics and experienced failure of his lungs and kidneys (approximately in 2019, exact date was not provided). On an unspecified date in 2019, the patient died, after being transferred to nursing center. Cause of death was not reported. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The outcome of pneumonia bacterial, fatigue, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, renal failure and respiratory failure was reported as not recovered/not resolved. The outcome of adverse event was unknown. The causality assessment between pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(PNEUMOVAX23) and the events was not provided.  Upon internal review, the events of renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia bacterial and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were determined to be medically significant.</td>\n",

The subject's mother was 33-year-old  pregnant female of body weight: 246 Ibs, height: 67 in and body mass index (BMI) 38.5 enrolled in a prospective observational safety study.  The subject's mother current medical condition included history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension (GHTN), anxiety, nausea, vomiting, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and obesity.   The subject's mother concomitant medication included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) for pregnancy, Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate) for anxiety, promethazine for nausea and vomiting and Lovenox (enoxaparin sodium) for history of venous thromboembolism.  The subject's mother had no previous pregnancies. The subject's mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCMs). The subject's mother had no history of offspring with MCM. The subject's mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The subject's mother last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2019. Estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 30-Mar-2020 and corrected estimated delivery date (CEDD) was not reported.   The type of pregnancy was singleton.    On 18-Sep-2019, the subject's mother underwent first sequential and nuchal translucency. No MCMs were noted.  On 16-Oct-2019, at approximately 16 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Afluria QIV [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell cultured derived, batch number: P100112488, dose, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as Â‘Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation.  On the same day, the subject's mother underwent second sequential and no MCMs were noted.  On 30-Oct-2019, the subject's mother underwent early glucose tolerance test and per reporter, it failed.  On 04-Nov-2019, the subject's mother underwent three-hour glucose tolerance test and no MCMs were noted.  At approximately 22 weeks of gestation, mother vaginally delivered a stillbirth male neonate, (explicitly coded as 'Premature birth'). The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The characteristics of the neonate included weight: 417 grams, head circumference and length were not reported. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were not reported. No MCMs were identified at the time of birth. On the same day, the subject's mother was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome (characterised with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count). It was reported that the factors that may had impact on fetal loss included mother's HELLP syndrome and history of DVT. It was unknown whether the autopsy was performed.  The event of stillbirth is considered as serious due to fatal outcome, while the events of low birth weight baby and premature birth are considered as serious due to criterion of medical significance.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  This case is linked to case 201907406 (corresponding mother case).  Company comment: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of venous thromboembolism, gestational hypertension and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy may have contributed to development of the events. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related. The event foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender's Comments: The patient experienced preterm birth and low birth weight, one months and 14 days after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. The pregnancy outcome was stillbirth. The subject's mother was administered vaccine at approximately 16 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible.
