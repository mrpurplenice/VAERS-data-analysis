Pertinent medical history, drug reactions and allergies, and concomitant medications were reported as none.  Early in June 2017, the patient was vaccinated with a second dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) in the left arm for prophylaxis (route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported).   In June 2017, reported as later that same date after received the vaccine, she started to feel sick. She reported that her stomach started to hurt, had chills, and her arms hurt. As the day progressed, her sickness continually \"got worse and worse\". She reported that she was freezing despite tons of clothing and layers on. The next day her arm had swollen like a balloon and became hard as a rock. At one point she passed out and hit her head on her dresser. When she woke up, she couldn't see, and eventually her sight came back in blobs/spots (blindness transient). Over the next week, approximately in June 2017, it progressively became worse and she reported being so dizzy that she couldn't walk (blindness transient) around her house without grabbing onto a wall (Gait inability). Her heart was \"loudly\" palpating (Heart rate decreased) and she had an extremely low blood pressure. One doctor told her that her \"heart is just not operating as it should\", however a different doctor said her heart was fine. After completing a detox, changing her diet, and taking vitamin supplements she slowly started feeling better (also reported as not recovered by the same reporter). She reported that she \"hasn't been the same\" since she received that re-vaccination. She still currently experienced dizziness from time to time and was afraid to take the COVlD-19 vaccine due to her adverse experience with the pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) vaccine. None laboratory test was performed  The outcome of illness, hypotension, heart rate decreased, gait inability, dizziness, head injury, induration, peripheral swelling, feeling cold, pain in extremity, chills and abdominal pain upper was reported as not recovered. The outcome of loss of consciousness and blindness transient was reported as recovered, on an unspecified date in 2017 (conflicting information also reported as not recovered).

A female patient of an unspecified age received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 21Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, chills and body temperature max of 101.2 F on 22Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 23Dec2020. On 22Dec2020 she spent the day in bed. The reporting nurse stated that the patient was part of a trial study. She was vaccinated in a blind study on 28Nov2020. The patient told the reporter on 23Dec2020 that she called the intake person the week before and they told her to take the vaccine here with Pfizer. She called them back after she experienced the events and spoke with a different person who stated she should not have taken the vaccine with Pfizer. They will not un-blind her at this point either. The reporter felt certain based on her response last week that she must have received the vaccine on 28Nov2020 and not the placebo. The patient wished to drop from the study and take the 2nd Pfizer vaccine in 3 weeks. Her PCP agreed that she should do so.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  \n",

No information was provided regarding medical history, concurrent conditions, or concomitant medications. On or about 01-JUN-2014, the pt was inoculated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (strength, dose, dose number, route, anatomical site of vaccination, lot number and expiration date were not provided) as prescribed and/or administered by a pharmacist for the long-term prevention of shingles and/or zoster-related conditions. On an unknown date (reported as subsequent to pt's zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) inoculation), the pt was treated by a physician for vision loss (blindness) and other zoster-related conditions (ill-defined disorder). On an unknown date, he was admitted to the hospital due to the events. As a direct and proximate result of pt's use of the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the patient had and would continue suffer ongoing injuries, including but not limited to: mental and physical pain and suffering; medical care and treatment for these injuries; significant medical and related expenses as a result of these injuries, including but not limited to medical losses and costs include care for hospitalization, physician care, monitoring, treatment, medications, and supplies; diminished capacity for the enjoyment of life; diminished quality of life; increased risk of premature death, aggravation of preexisting conditions and activation of latent conditions; and other losses and damages; and would continue to suffer such losses, and damages in the future. At the time of this report, the outcome of blindness and ill-defined disorder was unknown. The lawyer considered the events to be related to zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX).  Upon internal review, blindness was considered a medically significant event.  \n",

Taste was better by 7 pm (8.5 hours after injection).  After going to bed started to suffer chills and severe muscle aches.  Took Motrin for the pain.  Severe muscle aches and pain in sinuses continue at the time of submitting this report.  My wife suffered similar side effects to the first Shingles.  Additional Background information.  my wife and I both tested positive for Covid on Nov 2 2020.  We both took part in an phase 2 antibody trial.  Since this is a double blind trial, we don't know who received the antibodies, but my wife's condition did not improve where mine improved almost immediately after the infusion  \n",

              "61843   Neuropraxia of Left Arm; A PHASE 1/2/3, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, OBSERVER-BLIND, DOSE-FINDING STUDY TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND EFFICACY OF SARS-COV-2 RNA VACCINE CANDIDATES AGAINST COVID-19 IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS  This is a report from an interventional study source for Protocol C4591001 sponsored by BioNTech, managed and reported by Pfizer on the sponsor's behalf. The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender's Comments: The event \"Nerve Injury\" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event \"Nerve Injury\" to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer's safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.

I was tired and realized I couldn't see. I thought I didn't have my eyes open, so I waved my hand in front of my face and realized I couldn't see any light movement at all. I told my father who was driving, and he turned around and took me back to the vaccine administration site.  We arrived back at the site about 20-25 minutes after my injection. I remember they took my temperature and my blood pressure, they may have checked my O2 levels but I'm not certain. They asked me questions about my sight, what I could see. Eventually, I started being able to see light again and could make out shadows. I believe this was about 40-50 minutes after my injection, my vision started coming back slowly, and when it fully returned they had my dad take me home.  \n",

The pt's COVID-19  screening questionnaire prior to receiving the vaccine was negative. The pt presented to the ED on 01/13/21 for weakness and m  PCR test on ultiple recent falls (since receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine). The pt's COVID-19 01/13/20  was positive and he was admitted. He was started on treatment with remdesivir + dexamethasone on 1/14. The pt initially required supplemental oxygen via low-flow NC, however his oxygen requirements increased to 100% NRB. On 01/16/21 his MPOA elected for hospice care.  The pt passed on 01/17/21.

On the second day I started having problems with my vision in my left eye, I went blind for 20minutes. When I did get my Vision back I got and slight headache.  About 3am in the morning, I woke up like someone hit me in the head with a hammer. After that every second or third day the pain would come back and it would be worse, it brought tears to my eyes. I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I'm not having them as much. I'm calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.  \n",

A female patient of an unspecified age (Age: 67; Unit: Unknown) received her first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 (on the 07 or 08 of this month) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included she had pre-existing conditions having floaters and headaches.  The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on the 07 or 08 of this month. She stated she had pre-existing conditions having floaters and headaches. This could be coincidental, but there was an increase in frequency. She asked if it was ok to get the second vaccine. She asked if there was any information on floater or blindness. She wanted to know if it was okay to take Benadryl. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  \n",

No information was provided regarding the pt's medical history, concurrent conditions, previous drug reactions, allergies and concomitant medications. On an unspecified date, the pt was inoculated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (strength, dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not provided) for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). On an unspecified date, after receiving zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt suffered herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, encephalitis, right eye vision loss (blindness unilateral), headaches and balance issues (balance disorder). As a result of these symptoms, the pt was seen and treated by medical providers and is still under their care. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the pt's symptoms have resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using this product. The pt sustained serious, severe, permanent, progressive and incurable personal injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, mental and emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of the condition. The pt have suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. The outcome of the events was considered not recovered and causality was related to zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX). The reporter considered the events to be disabling. Upon internal review, the pt's encephalitis and blindness unilateral were determined to be medically significant events.  \n",

About 6 hours after 1st vaccine had visual disturbances in left eye, got  a little better after a week or so, but still has a floater in left eye, had 2nd dose and after 72 hours had to leave work (never left work before) to get emergency eye exam - thought I was going blind - diagnosed with \"Posterior Vitreous Detachment\".  Now I still have a BIG thing in field of vision making it hard to see and \"thousands\" of tiny black floaters.  Hard to see out of right eye.  \n",

The pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced.  I thought i was having a brain aneurysm.   My ears started ringing at that time (Tinnitus). I thought is was just because I had the headache, but  it has been three weeks now and it has not stopped, even for a moment.  I have never had tinnitus before.  \n",

At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist's answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference \"physical\" with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my \"end of visit vitals\" were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5'11\", temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.  \n",

Second dose woke up at 11:00 pm with fever chills, blinding headache, nausea, sever coughing, SOB and chest tightness. Called caregiver hotline the next day and they sent me to the Care where it was found my BP to be 225/120 and pulse 100. They sent me to the emergency department at Hospital where I was treated for hypertensive urgency and immunization reaction. Still suffering from elevated BP and pulse beyond what was normal prior to vaccine. Still experiencing fatigue and weakness that was not present prior to vaccine.  \n",

The subject was in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred. A 72-year-old female subject received first and second dose of blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) on 31Aug2020 and 21Sep2020 respectively. She then received third dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 13Jan2021 at 15:48 and fourth dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 02Feb2021 at 11:50, both intramuscularly on left deltoid as single doses, all for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia from 2010 and ongoing, sleep apnea from 2010 and ongoing, left knee osteoarthritis from 2014 to 2017 (with left total knee arthroplasty), osteoporosis from 2016 and ongoing and basal cell carcinoma on nose in 2018. No concomitant vaccines or prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were received. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event (AE) was unknown. Ongoing concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTROGEL) as hormone replacement from 2019, denosumab (PROLIA) for osteoporosis from 2017, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) for insomnia from 2010; and ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), zinc, vitamin B6, quercetin and glucosamine, all as health supplement from Mar2020.  On 03Feb2021, the subject experienced vertigo with serious criteria of medically significant and hospitalization. The event required a visit to emergency room. The clinical course was as follows: Around midnight on 03Feb2021, the subject did not feel well with severe chills. She got up out of bed and went to the bathroom. She experienced vertigo, fell and hit her head. She was found bleeding by her husband who called the ambulance. She was taken to the hospital and had 7 stitches placed. She was still in the hospital at the time of the report. The action taken in response to the event for study vaccine BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of event was not recovered.  The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event vertigo was related to the study vaccine but not related to concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.; Sender's Comments: The event \"Vertigo\" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  The information provided is very limited and mainly anecdotal. Results of the diagnostic workup during hospitalization are not available. The company considers there is not a reasonable possibility that the event, vertigo, is related to vaccine administration based on the latency, the circumstances and a possible role of concomitant medication zolpidem.  Pfizer's safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 15-JAN-2021 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Vertigo. Review of the database for the PT Vertigo had the following results: 2 serious clinical trial cases (0 of which were attributed to therapy) and 109 non clinical trial cases.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.  \n",

There were a majority of vaccines to small towns around the state instead of to the densest most Covid ridden population in the state.  So many cancellations from the many travelling that they closed early and had many openings so I received the COVID shot myself as well.   The two men felt fine after.  My arm hurt badly for the first 3 days, still tender yet much better today, 2/19.  Evening of shot I vomited.  FEb 16,  day extremely tired and  felt overheated all day with muscle aches. .  Vomited in afternoon and evening.  Wed, 17th, ran a fever, slept late and felt dizzy and tired, all day vomiting  every time after trying to eat.  Thur 18th, Vomiting all day with chills and fever.

I went to the bathroom, where I felt pressure in my head, increased ringing in my ears, and increased loss of vision. A few moments later when I realized this was an emergency, I could no longer see or walk. I crawled blindly through the home feeling for the walls and familiar facets calling out for help. My family woke up and called emergency. By then, I was nearly gone/unconscious.  I was laid down on cold tile until the paramedics arrived. Heart, blood sugar, and blood pressure were all tested. Considering I'm a completely healthy individual, they attributed it to the vaccine.  \n",

I kept it down to 105 with OTC meds. Sometimes too high for thermometer to read.  - Swelling at injection site (and halfway to elbow), soreness. By Monday this was down to about a golf ball, and it resolved in a week.  - Fatigue, slept all weekend and was tired but functioning the following week.  - Severe joint pain and muscle aches Saturday and Sunday. I took OTC pain relievers. Went to bed.  - Blindingly bad migraine Friday night, worse Saturday, and resolving some on Sunday, somewhat responsive to Naratryptin.  \n",

A contactable consumer reported for herself, a female patient of an unspecified age (reported as 63, no units) who received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated she had the first dose of the vaccine and felt a little tired and a little anxious one day but she felt it was because she was nervous about getting it. The patient stated she was legally blind and it was hard for her to read some things. The patient asked how long side effects will last, if she would get any, and if how long do the symptoms last after the second dose. She also asked if one did not have any side effects after the first vaccine, could they still get side effects after the second.

The patient's medical history included blindness and severe allergies to shellfish.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Losartan and Melatonin.    On 28 JAN 2021, approximately 15  minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient's wife called to indicate that her husband had an anaphylactic reaction to the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Patient received the vaccine on 28 JAN 2021 in his left arm. Patient's wife indicated that her husband texted her at 3.21 pm to let her know that he has gotten the shot, indicating that he must have received it around 3.19 pm. Patient's wife indicated that around 3.34 pm, patient said he'd had an anaphylactic reaction, that he had administered a shot of epinephrine and that an ambulance was on its way. The patient's wife noted that the reaction happened within 15 minutes or so. Once in the hospital, the patient was administered Pepcid and Steroid orally. Additional treatment medication for the event included the previously epinephrine and a shot of Benadryl.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the event was unknown.; Reporter's Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

A patient of unspecified age and gender received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot number and expiration date not provided, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing macular degeneration (the patient had in the past, actually quite a number of years, macular degeneration on that same eye). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had the vaccine and on the 8th of this month (not clarified), that was five or six days ago the patient really went well for both the days and both injections. But on Friday, two days ago, it began a little bit on Thursday evening but on Friday the patient noticed that the right eye started to blow up and a big black spot is coming in front of it, especially when the patient went to the bathroom and put on the light and that eye was totally blinded and then when the patient dabbed it with water and things and dried it up, it started to come back.

Pertinent medical history, drug reactions and allergies, and concomitant medications were reported as none.  Early in June 2017, the patient was vaccinated with a second dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) in the left arm for prophylaxis (route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported).   In June 2017, reported as later that same date after received the vaccine, she started to feel sick. She reported that her stomach started to hurt, had chills, and her arms hurt. As the day progressed, her sickness continually \"got worse and worse\". She reported that she was freezing despite tons of clothing and layers on. The next day her arm had swollen like a balloon and became hard as a rock. At one point she passed out and hit her head on her dresser. When she woke up, she couldn't see, and eventually her sight came back in blobs/spots (blindness transient). Over the next week, approximately in June 2017, it progressively became worse and she reported being so dizzy that she couldn't walk (blindness transient) around her house without grabbing onto a wall (Gait inability). Her heart was \"loudly\" palpating (Heart rate decreased) and she had an extremely low blood pressure. One doctor told her that her \"heart is just not operating as it should\", however a different doctor said her heart was fine. After completing a detox, changing her diet, and taking vitamin supplements she slowly started feeling better (also reported as not recovered by the same reporter). She reported that she \"hasn't been the same\" since she received that re-vaccination.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender's Comments: The event \"Nerve Injury\" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event \"Nerve Injury\" to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer's safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.</td>\n",

She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.

Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.

A 72-year-old female subject received first and second dose of blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) on 31Aug2020 and 21Sep2020 respectively. She then received third dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 13Jan2021 at 15:48 and fourth dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 02Feb2021 at 11:50, both intramuscularly on left deltoid as single doses, all for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia from 2010 and ongoing, sleep apnea from 2010 and ongoing, left knee osteoarthritis from 2014 to 2017 (with left total knee arthroplasty), osteoporosis from 2016 and ongoing and basal cell carcinoma on nose in 2018. No concomitant vaccines or prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were received. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event (AE) was unknown. Ongoing concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTROGEL) as hormone replacement from 2019, denosumab (PROLIA) for osteoporosis from 2017, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) for insomnia from 2010; and ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), zinc, vitamin B6, quercetin and glucosamine, all as health supplement from Mar2020.  On 03Feb2021, the subject experienced vertigo with serious criteria of medically significant and hospitalization. The event required a visit to emergency room. The clinical course was as follows: Around midnight on 03Feb2021, the subject did not feel well with severe chills. She got up out of bed and went to the bathroom. She experienced vertigo, fell and hit her head. She was found bleeding by her husband who called the ambulance. She was taken to the hospital and had 7 stitches placed. She was still in the hospital at the time of the report. The action taken in response to the event for study vaccine BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of event was not recovered.  The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event vertigo was related to the study vaccine but not related to concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.; Sender's Comments: The event \"Vertigo\" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  The information provided is very limited and mainly anecdotal. Results of the diagnostic workup during hospitalization are not available. The company considers there is not a reasonable possibility that the event, vertigo, is related to vaccine administration based on the latency, the circumstances and a possible role of concomitant medication zolpidem.  Pfizer's safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 15-JAN-2021 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Vertigo. Review of the database for the PT Vertigo had the following results: 2 serious clinical trial cases (0 of which were attributed to therapy) and 109 non clinical trial cases.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

About a week later, patient tested positive for COVID 19.  She had a number of chronic, underlying health conditions.  The vaccine did not have enough time to prevent COVID 19.  There is no evidence that the vaccination caused patient's death.  It simply didn't have time to save her life.  \n",
