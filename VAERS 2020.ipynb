of the left eye; This initial spontaneous report was received from a lawyer regarding a case in litigation and refers to a female patient of an unknown age. No information was provided regarding medical history, concurrent conditions, or concomitant medications. On or around 17-OCT-2017, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (exact dose, dose number, route and site of administration, lot# and expiration date were not reported), for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). On an unknown date, shortly after receiving the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient suffered an acute onset of left eye vision loss. The patient was admitted to the hospital and she was ultimately diagnosed with central retinal artery occlusion of the left eye and was completely blind in her left eye, at the reporting time. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) use, the patient's symptoms had resulted in physical limitations not present prior to vaccination. The patient also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitation and seriousness of her condition. As a result of the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) use, the patient sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, as a tragic consequence of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) use, the patient suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. The outcome of the event was reported as not recovered. The relatedness between the event and zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) was reported as related.  Upon internal review, the event of central retinal artery occlusion of the left eye was considered to be medically significant.  The event of central retinal artery occlusion of the left eye was considered to be disabling.  \n","407

central flashing lights in her right eye, Photopsia of oculus dextrus (OD); nonpigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole; enlarged blind spot in the right eye; Initial information received on 06-Jan-2020 regarding an unsolicited valid serious case issued from a physician via literature full article  The following is the abstract from the article: 27-year-old female presented to clinic with photopsias OD. Her symptoms began 2 weeks following intradermal influenza vaccination. Fundus examination and diagnostic testing were consistent with MEWDS. This is a report of MEWDS following intradermal influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination is recommended for the elderly, pregnant, and patients with asthma, in addition to other high-risk groups. During the 2015-2016 flu season, over 146 million doses were distributed.2 Influenza vaccination is safe, widely administered, and welltolerated with minor side effects including localized swelling at the injection site, arthralgias, and low-grade fevers. Serious side effects are very rare. The risk of autoimmune phenomenon following flu vaccination is a debated topic.3 Multiple Evanescent White-Dot Syndrome is predominantly unilateral and is more commonly seen in young myopic women.4 Several small (100-200 micrometers) discrete white lesions are witnessed deep in the retina or situated at level of the retinal pigment epithelium. The lesions are concentrated in the posterior pole, primarily in the perifoveal region, while sparing the fovea. The lesions are characterized by early hyperfluorescence and late staining on fluorescein angiography. A granular appearance to the macula is also seen with irregularity of the internal limiting membrane reflex.   This case involves a 27 years old female patient who experienced multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (retinal exudates), confrontation visual field test revealed central loss in the right eye and full visual field in the left eye (central vision loss), anterior vitreous inflammation of oculus dextrus (OD) (iridocyclitis), retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) irregularities (retinal pigment epitheliopathy), central flashing lights in her right eye, photopsia of oculus dextrus (OD) (photopsia), nonpigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole (chorioretinal scar) and enlarged blind spot in the right eye (visual field defect), while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  The patient's medical history included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Vesicoureteric reflux, Endometriosis, fibroadenomas, Depression, Tonsillectomy and Vesicoureteral reflux surgery. The patient's past medical treatment included ATENOLOL with 25 milligram one a day and CENTRUM PLUS with one a day. The patient's past vaccination(s) and family history were not provided. At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing Chronic kidney disease, allergies to multiple antibiotics and Non-tobacco user.   On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via intradermal route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (retinal exudates), confrontation visual field test revealed central loss in the right eye and full visual field in the left eye (central vision loss), anterior vitreous inflammation of oculus dextrus (OD) (iridocyclitis) and retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) irregularities (retinal pigment epitheliopathy) (Unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. These events was assessed as medically significant. On an unknown date, the patient developed a non-serious central flashing lights in her right eye, photopsia of oculus dextrus (OD) (photopsia), two weeks following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. On an unknown date, the patient developed a non-serious nonpigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole (chorioretinal scar) and enlarged blind spot in the right eye (visual field defect) (Unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Relevant laboratory test results included Fluorescence angiogram abnormal, Intraocular pressure test: 12 mmHg visual acuity tests : 20/25-2 OD unit and [20/20 OS] and visual field tests done on an unknown date.  (Other relevant tests included Pupillary reaction, motility, and adnexa exam were unremarkable. A Confrontation Visual Field test revealed central loss in the right eye and full visual field in the left eye.  Fundus examination of the right eye revealed scattered non-pigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole. The optic nerve appeared normal.  Fluorescein Angiography of the right eye showed multiple round lesions in the posterior pole with early hyper-fluorescence and late staining  Fundus examination OS was normal. Humphrey visual field testing revealed an enlarged blind spot in the right eye. The macular lesions on exam had resolved with mild residual RPE mottling.  She did not report any symptoms from her left eye. And she did not drink. A comprehensive review of systems was negative for fever, rash, oral ulcers, arthralgias, headache, or vertigo. There was no history of recent viral illness. Pupillary reaction, motility, and adnexa exam were unremarkable. The optic nerve appeared normal. Fundus examination OS was normal.  Final diagnosis was retinal exudates, central vision loss, iridocyclitis, retinal pigment epitheliopathy, photopsia, chorioretinal scar and visual field defect.   No corrective treatment was received.  The patient was recovering from the events.  Vaccines work by exposing the immune system to specific pathogenic features that prime the immune response through adaptive immunity as well as cellular memory. Excessive lymphocyte activation, abnormal cytokine expression, and molecular mimicry are several possible mechanisms that could potentially play a role in the development of autoimmune phenomena following vaccination.  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 27 years old female patient who presented with retinal exudates, central vision loss, iridocyclitis, retinal pigment epitheliopathy, photopsia, chorioretinal scar and visual field defect after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE. Time to onset is compatible for photopsia and unknown for other events. Patients medical condition at the time of vaccination was Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Vesicoureteric reflux, Endometriosis, fibroadenomas, Depression, Tonsillectomy and Vesicoureteral reflux surgery and tests showed abnormal Fluorescence angiogram. Based upon the reported information, the role of the vaccine cannot be assessed.  \n","4654

physician via a company representative, referring to an 11 year old female patient.  No information was provided regarding the patient's medical history, concurrent conditions or concomitant medications.    In March 2019, the patient was administered the first dose of hpv rl1 6 11 16 18 31 33 45 52 58 vlp vaccine (yeast)(GARDASIL 9) (strength, dose, route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis.  On the same month, the patient was also administered the \"TDAP\"  and \"Meningococcal \" vaccines, (strength, dose, route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported) also for prophylaxis.  On an unspecified day in September 2019, the patient was vaccinated with the second dose of hpv rl1 6 11 16 18 31 33 45 52 58 vlp vaccine (yeast)(GARDASIL 9) for prophylaxis (dose, route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported).     In November 2019 (also reported as \"two months later\"), the patient experienced blindness in one eye; the patient sought medical attention and was seen in the emergency department of an unspecified hospital where she was diagnosed with optical neuromyelitis (neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder).  It was unknown if the patient received any treatment, or if any laboratory test was performed.     On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.  The reporter did not assess the causal relationship between therapy with hpv rl1 6 11 16 18 31 33 45 52 58 vlp vaccine (yeast)(GARDASIL 9), \"TDAP\"  and \"Meningococcal \" vaccines and the event.        Upon internal review, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder was determined to be medically significant.  \n","11299

Concomitant therapies included simvastatin (manufacturer unknown), omeprazole, gabapentin, metoprolol, lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), escitalopram, lorazepam, fluticasone, amlodipine besylate, hydrochlorothiazide, acetaminophen (+) hydrocodone bitartrate, terconazole and ondansetron.    On 16-OCT-2013 the patient was vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) (dose, route, strength, batch/lot# and expiration date were unknown) for pneumonia (product use in unapproved indication).        The case is linked to case# US-009507513-2001USA010186 due to the same patient.; Sender's Comments:  US-009507513-2001USA010186:  \n","11759  Lichen Planus;   Information was received on 03MAR2020 from an Investigator.  A 29-year-old male was diagnosed with lichen planus after the administration of all the three doses of the blinded study drug.  Study drug administration dates:  06MAY2019: Dose 1 20MAY2019: Dose 2 03JUN2019: Dose 3  On 06MAY2019, the subject received the first dose of the blinded study drug. After two weeks, on 20MAY2019, he received the second dose, and on 03JUN2019, he received his last dose of the study drug.   On 22NOV2019, 172 days after the last dose, he presented to the clinic with chief complaints of rash and red bumps on his hands, forearms, and shins ongoing since two weeks. Rash was located on his wrist, going up to his arms and shoulders. His bumps were somewhat itchy and resembled bug bites. Rashes appeared as blisters and flaky spots. No one else in his house had a rash or similar bumps. He denied fever, pets in the home, history of eczema or asthma. On the same day, his vital sign measurement showed a body mass index (BMI) of 35.8 kg/m2, blood pressure was 118/79 mmHg, temperature was 97.4 F, heart rate was 87 beats per minute and oxygen saturation was 97 %. Physical examination revealed skin with multiple scattered erythematous papules on the dorsal hands, volar wrists, forearms and anterior lower legs. He was administered dexamethasone sodium phosphate Injection Solution and Depo-medrol (methylprednisolone acetate) injection. He was also advised to start triamcinolone acetonide external cream for topical application and Zyrtec, and to follow up if the symptoms persist or worsen.  On 09DEC2019, he came for follow up visit with continued red and itchy bumps on his wrists, forearms and shins. He had been using topical triamcinolone as prescribed without any improvement. He denied fever, chest pain, shortness of breath or any family member with similar symptoms. The rash was not always bothersome or itchy, but it did not improve. He was advised to continue using triamcinolone for two weeks, followed by interruption for a week and then restart as required. He was encouraged to continue good skin care.  On 16DEC2019, he presented again for a follow-up due to a persistent rash. Despite oral, injection, and topical steroids, there was not much improvement. Physical examination revealed 1 mm to 10 mm round to linear red papules, vesicles, and scaly patches on volar wrists, forearms, shoulders, and shins. A shave biopsy of a right arm lesion confirmed lichen planus. Microscopic examination revealed acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis. Sub-epidermal vesicle formation was present associated with underlying acute and chronic in?ammation which obscured the dermal-epidermal junction. There was no evidence of malignancy.   Medical history included environmental and seasonal allergies and wisdom tooth extraction. Also had a positive history of blistering sunburns and denied history of psoriasis and eczema. There was no personal or family history of skin cancer.  Family history included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (maternal grandmother) and rheumatoid arthritis (maternal grandfather).  Outcome: The subject had not recovered at the time of report.   The Investigator assessed the event lichen planus to be possibly related to therapy with study drug.  Medical Monitor assessed the event as unexpected and possibly related to study product administration. It is not possible to exclude causality at this time due to the event being reported post-enrolment in the study, even though the immuno-stimulatory effect of CPG is transient as demonstrated by clinical studies. The subject last received study product about six months prior to the onset of the event. Though the etiology of lichen planus is currently unknown, no cases have been reported in other clinical studies involving higher doses of CPG 7909 when used as monotherapy, in combination with anti-cancer therapies or as vaccine adjuvants. Thus, there is currently no known association between CPG 7909 and lichen planus.  The case was reviewed by the Board on 09MAR2020: The Physician indicated the diagnosis might be possible related, even given the time lapse.  Company Assessment: The Company assessed the event as possibly related.  The six-month timespan between blinded study drug exposure makes causality unlikely especially with the known transient immuno-stimulatory effect of CPG; however, causality is unable to be definitely excluded at this time.  Analysis of Similar Events: Case involves a 29-year-old male who was diagnosed with lichen planus 172 days after receiving the last dose of blinded study product.  The subject received all 3 doses of the blinded study drug with the last dose being on03JUN2019.  On 22NOV2019, he presented to the clinic complaining of a rash of red bumps on his hands, forearms, and shins for two weeks.  Nobody else in the household complained of similar systems.  Physical examination revealed skin with multiple scattered erythematous papules on the dorsal hands, volar wrists, forearms, and anterior lower legs.  Medical history included environmental and seasonal allergies and denied history of psoriasis and eczema.  The subject was administered a corticosteroid injection, along with topical treatment and Zyrtec.  On 09DEC2019, he returned for follow-up visit with without any improvement.  He was advised to continue using triamcinolone for two weeks, followed by interruption for a week, and then restart as required.  On 16DEC2019, he presented again for follow-up due to no improvement.

He was then put in an induced coma to control the seizures. But it was too late, the MRI showed encephalitis and brain injury. He never really woke up. He is left with dystonia and corticol blindness. Is wheelchair bound and unable to speak or communicate. My son was a healthy, walking, talking 4 year old before all of this!  \n","12244                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Rheumatoid arthritis;   Information was received on 05MAR2020 from an Investigator.   A 41-year-old female was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) approximately 1 month after the third dose of the blinded study drug.  Study drug administration dates: 10MAY2019: Dose 1 24MAY2019: Dose 2 07JUN2019: Dose 3  The subject received the first dose of study product on 10MAY2020 (Day 1).  Day 1 baseline labs revealed a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a titer of 1:40 and a rheumatoid factor (RF) titer of 10 IU/mL (ref range is 0-14 IU/mL).  On 24MAY2019 (Day 15), the subject she was informed of her laboratory results in detail.  She agreed to continue with study treatment per protocol and received the second dose on the same day.  On 07JUN2019 (Day 29), though not part of routine testing, the PI requested a repeat ANA test considering the initial positive outcome.  The repeat test was positive at 1:40 (unchanged from the Day 1).  She was instructed to follow-up with rheumatology due to the positive results.  On the same day, she received her last dose of the study drug.   On 12JUL2019 (Day 64), an ANA test showed an increase to 1:80 with the RF titer remaining consistent with Day 1 labs (10 IU/ml).  She was informed of her result.  The subject stated she had visited a Rheumatologist, but she was unsure about her diagnosis. She was not taking any medication at that time.    The subject was requested to visit the site for the Day 302 visit.  During the visit, she informed the Sub-Investigator of a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was taking Sulfasalazine and Meloxicam.   Subsequently on 05MAR2020, repeat laboratory testing was performed.  Results are pending at the time of this report.  Medical records have been requested.   Outcome: The subject had not recovered at the time of report.   Concomitant therapy included Radiance (drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol) for birth control.    The action taken with study drug was not applicable as the rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed after the last dose of study drug.   The Investigator assessed the event of grade 1 (mild) rheumatoid arthritis to be possibly related to therapy with study drug.  Medical Monitor assessed the event as unexpected and unrelated to the study products, based on the currently available information. The assessment may change if redacted medical records are received substantiating the diagnosis and it's justification. This event is unexpected and unrelated based on the fact that subject is said to be asymptomatic, and pre-vaccination & post-vaccination (Day 64) RF titers were 10 IU/mL and 10 IU/ml respectively within normal limits (0-14 IU/mL). BUN and creatinine were also within normal limits at Day 1 and 29. Though there was some increase in ANA titer from 1:40 to 1:80 from pre-vaccination to Day 64, this is not enough to substantiate this diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.  A preliminary assessment by a member of the safety board indicated the RF is normal, but the diagnosis of RA is also based upon cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints on exam.  As a result, this assessment may change based on the results of anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) pre- and post-vaccination and redacted medical records  Company Comment: The Company assessed the event as not related to exposure with the blinded study product.  The assessment is based up the following:  there is no confirmed diagnosis, the subject is asymptomatic, ANA positive tests alone are not indicative alone, RF titer was negative, and lack of objective physical exam findings.  Medical records have been requested to confirm by objective evidence of additional testing/physical examination.; Sender's Comments: The Company assessed the event as not related to exposure with the blinded study product.

On 19-AUG-2008, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of Zoster Vaccine Live (ZOSTAVAX) (dosage, route, lot # and expiration date were not provided) at a public health center. As a result of her receipt of vaccination, on unspecified date in 2008, the patient was treated for vision loss (blindness) and shingles including any and all its sequelae. It has been caused to suffer serious and dangerous side effects including shingles, as well as other severe and personal injuries which were permanent and lasting in nature, physical pain and mental anguish, including diminished enjoyment of life, as well as the need for lifelong medical treatment, monitoring and/or medications. At the time of the report, the patient's outcome was unknown, and the reporter considered blindness and shingles to be related to Zoster Vaccine Live (ZOSTAVAX).  The reporter considered the event of blindness and shingles to be disabling.

Co-suspect products included Herpes zoster (Shingles vaccine) for prophylaxis.   Previously administered products included Shingles accine (received 1st dose in September 2019). Concomitant products included alprazolam (Xanax).   In March 2020, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingles vaccine. On an unknown date, the patient received the 3rd dose of Shingles vaccine. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after receiving Shingles vaccine and not applicable after receiving Shingles vaccine, the patient experienced pain, malaise, pain in arm, fever, swelling arm, red rash, fatigue, somnolence, sleep disorder, anxiety, phobia, drug dose administration interval too long and extra dose administered. On an unknown date, the outcome of the pain, malaise, fever, swelling arm, red rash, fatigue, somnolence, sleep disorder, anxiety, phobia, drug dose administration interval too long and extra dose administered were unknown and the outcome of the pain in arm was recovered/resolved.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the pain, malaise, pain in arm, fever, swelling arm and red rash to be related to Shingles vaccine. It was unknown if the reporter considered the fatigue, somnolence, sleep disorder, anxiety and phobia to be related to Shingles vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: The age at vaccination was not reported. The patient received Shingrix and did not realize the 2nd dose vaccine appointment for the trial was a week later, so the patient had to push back the 2nd dose by a month, so they could wait for the shingles vaccine to take effects. The shingles vaccine was a terrible vaccine, painful and had severe reaction to them because it was injected into the muscle. The patient was sick as dog for few days. The vaccine was miserable, but was a believer in vaccine. No further information was provided. The patient reported that the study he was in, was a double-blind study, so the patient did not know for sure if received the vaccine or not, but he believes he received the vaccine because he had reactions, but they were not terrible.  The patient arm hurt for week after and was not bad and it was far less painful than the shingles vaccine was horrible. Then he had a fever a couple of times for a couple days and he did not feel ill. It's also unusual for him to get a fever for anything, and if he did not it's usually a retrograde fever. There was some swelling in his arm and some red spots, for about a week. It was particularly the pain and swelling and usually he did not get reaction to vaccines, except for the shingles vaccine.  No further information provided. The patient reported over the phone that when he had the third dose of vaccine, he had problems with severe fatigue. He was sleeping constantly. One night, he slept for 14 hrs. or some ridiculous amount. And that was the week following the injection. He noted on the trial application the different symptoms and put down he had a severe problem last night, and the doctor called him the next morning because Pfizer contacted them.  The doctor said he heard the patient had trouble sleeping. The patient told the doctor that he did not think it was related to vaccine. Another doctor changed a medication, and he has severe sleep disorders, so the patient said he was not concerned. No further information provided. The patient reported over the phone that he has severe needle phobia. Shots are not too bad, but bloodwork was different story. And the first bloodwork he ever had, the nurse missed, and he went through the roof.  The patient thought he couldn't do it and usually pops a Xanax before the bloodwork. It's that bad. The last couple of times he went for blood work it was better.He had to ask the nurse if she was done, and she was done for like five minutes. For his most recent blood work, he went from the appointment immediately to the pharmacy for round-two because he wanted to get deal with the two jabs in a single day. It was a terror, and still gets very anxious before his appointments, so he still pops a Xanax.

to my on 8/10/2020.   On 8/13/2020 I woke up in the morning and my right ear was dead.  I could not hear at of it at all. My doctor said to get in to see and ENT.  I called healthcare provider and went to her on 8/17/20.  She did a hearing test and looked in my ear and said she feels I have SSHL.  I did blood work and I have an MRI of the brain on 9/1/20.  The side effects that I was given did not include the rare effects that the CDC states can have pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflamation or death.  I am scared to death I am going to have more effects.  Please get back to me about this asap.

Palsy; Zoster related vision loss; Information has been received from a lawyer regarding a case in litigation, regarding a female patient of unknown age (the patient's concurrent conditions, pertinent medical history, drug reactions/allergies and concomitant medications were not provided). On or about 30-SEP-3026, the patient received a dose of Zoster Vaccine Live (ZOSTAVAX) (dosage, route, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not provided) for the long-term prevention of shingles and/or zoster-related conditions, at the pharmacy. Subsequently, after receiving the vaccine, on unknown date, the patient was treated by a healthcare provider for Bell's Palsy (facial paralysis) and for zoster related vision loss (herpes zoster and blindness). As a direct and proximate result of patient's use of Zoster Vaccine Live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the patient have and will continue suffering ongoing injuries, including but not limited to significant medical and related expenses as result of these injuries, losses and costs included care for hospitalization, physical care, monitoring, treatment, medications, and supplies, diminished capacity for the enjoyment of life, diminished quality of life, increased risk of premature death, aggravation of preexisting conditions and activation of latent conditions. At the time of the report, the patient had not recovered from the events. The reporter considered the events to be related to Zoster Vaccine Live (ZOSTAVAX).  Upon internal review, the events of facial paralysis and blindness were considered medically significant.  \n","30473

report has been received from a consumer. The report concerns a male patient (age not provided) of Unknown ethnic origin.    No medical history was reported. The following demography was reported for the patient's parent:   Sex: Unknown    No concomitant products were reported.    The patient received Flumist (influenza virus vaccine live, intranasal) once/single administration, via nasal route, on an unknown date.     It was reported that patient had temporary blindness from his nasal flu vaccine when he was in the service. (preferred term: Blindness transient).     It was unknown if any action was taken with Flumist.    The outcome of the event temporary blindness was unknown.    The reporter considered the event temporary blindness serious due to important medical event.     Device Information:     Product As Reported: FLUMIST  Product Role: Suspect  Device code: Adverse Event Without Identified Device or Use Problem; Sender's Comments: Blindness transient is not listed in the company core data sheet of Quadrivalent/Live attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV). Due to limited information on relevant medical history, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications, exact start date of suspect drug, exact start date and circumstances leading to the events, complete etiologic and diagnostic workup ( Complete Ophthalmic examination, Imaging studies) it is not possible to make a conclusive assessment of the causal relationship of the event and suspect

patient was blind on one eye.; This case was reported by a physician via call center representative and described the occurrence of unilateral blindness in a adult patient who received Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis.   On an unknown date, the patient received the 1st dose of Shingrix. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced unilateral blindness (serious criteria GSK medically significant). On an unknown date, the outcome of the unilateral blindness was unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the unilateral blindness to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were reported as follows: The age at vaccination were not reported but adult has been selected as age group according to the vaccine. The patient received 1st dose of Shingrix 3 months ago from reporting date and was blind on one eye. According to reporter emergency room visit was required.

                zoster related vision loss; zoster related vision loss; Information has been received from a lawyer, regarding a case in litigation, and refers to a patient (pt) of unknown age and gender. No information about the pt's medical history, concurrent conditions and concomitant medications was provided. On an unknown date in 2016, the pt was inoculated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not provided) as prescribed and/or administered by a healthcare provider for the long-term prevention of shingles and/or zoster-related conditions. On an unknown date, subsequent to the pt's zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) inoculation, the pt was treated by a physician for zoster related vision loss. As a direct and proximate result of the pt's use of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt had and would continue suffer ongoing injuries, including but not limited to: mental and physical pain and suffering; medical care and treatment for these injuries; significant medical and related expenses as a result of these injuries, including but not limited to medical losses and costs include care for hospitalization, physician care, monitoring, treatment, medications, and supplies; diminished capacity for the enjoyment of life; diminished quality of life; increased risk of premature death, aggravation of preexisting conditions and activation of latent conditions; and other losses and damages; and would continue to suffer such losses, and damages in the future. The outcome of the events was considered to be not recovered. The reporter considered zoster related vision loss to be related to zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX).  Upon internal review, the event of blindness was determined to be medically significant.  \n","34814

(Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent unspecified season) for prophylaxis.   On an unknown date, the patient received Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent unspecified season. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent unspecified season, the patient experienced blind (serious criteria GSK medically significant). On an unknown date, the outcome of the blind was recovered/resolved.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the blind to be related to Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent unspecified season.  Additional details were provided as follows: The age at vaccination was not reported. After receiving Influenza vaccine, the patient became blind in one eye.  \n","37856

been received from a lawyer regarding a case in litigation and refers to a patient of unknown age and gender. No information was provided regarding medical history, concurrent conditions, or concomitant medications. In 2015, the patient was inoculated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (strength, dose, dose number, route, anatomical site of vaccination, lot number and expiration date were not provided) as prescribed and/or administered by a pharmacist for the long-term prevention of shingles and/or zoster-related conditions. On an unknown date (reported as subsequent to patient's zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) inoculation), the patient was treated by a physician for shingles (herpes zoster) and zoster related vision loss (blindness). On an unknown date, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to the events. As a direct and proximate result of patient's use of the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the patient had and would continue suffer ongoing injuries, including but not limited to: mental and physical pain and suffering; medical care and treatment for these injuries; significant medical and related expenses as a result of these injuries, including but not limited to medical losses and costs include care for hospitalization, physician care, monitoring, treatment, medications, and supplies; diminished capacity for the enjoyment of life; diminished quality of life; increased risk of premature death, aggravation of preexisting conditions and activation of latent conditions; and other losses and damages; and would continue to suffer such losses, and damages in the future. At the time of this report, the outcome of herpes zoster and blindness was unknown. The lawyer considered the events to be related to zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX).  Upon internal review, blindness was determined to be a medically significant event.  \n","41803

in her eyebrows fell out; Initial information received on 08-Oct-2020 regarding an unsolicited valid serious case received from a consumer or non-healthcare professional.  This case involves a seven-year-old female patient who lost vision completely in one eye (Blindness unilateral), had rashes (rash), severe headaches (headache) and hair in her eyebrows fell out (madarosis), while she received INFLUENZA VACCINE.  The patient's medical history, past medical treatment(s), vaccination(s), concomitant medications and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE (produced by unknown manufacturer, lot number and expiry date not reported) via an unknown route in an unknown administration site for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient lost vision completely in one eye (Blindness unilateral), had rashes (rash), severe headaches (headache) and hair in her eyebrows fell out (madarosis) (unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. Event blindness was assessed as medically significant. The patient was hospitalized for these events for a week.  Other relevant tests not reported.  It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  At the time of reporting, outcome was unknown for all the events.  Information on the batch number was requested.; Sender's Comments: This poorly documented case concerns a seven-year-old female patient who experienced Blindness unilateral, rash, headache and madarosis after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE (produced by unknown manufacturer). The time to onset was unknown. Moreover, patient's medical condition at the time of vaccination and lab tests ruling out alternate etiologies were not reported. Based upon the reported information, the role of the vaccine cannot be assessed.  \n","43213

lawyer, regarding a case in litigation, and refers to a patient (pt) of unknown age and gender. No information about the pt's medical history, concurrent conditions and concomitant medications was provided. On or about 14-OCT-2015, the pt was inoculated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not provided) for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). On unknown dates, shortly after receiving zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt suffered from herpes zoster, blindness in left eye, hearing loss, seizure, pneumonia and liver failure. As a result of these symptoms, the pt was seen and treated by medical providers and had been still under their care. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt's symptoms had resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using the suspect vaccine. The pt also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of the pt's condition.

                                             Single febrile seizure; This 12-month-old female subject was enrolled in a blinded study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of GSK Meningococcal Group B Vaccine and 13-valent Pneumococcal Vaccine when Administered Concomitantly with Routine Vaccines to Healthy Infants. The subject received the 4th dose of Bexsero vs Placebo co-administered with PCV and routine vaccines (intramuscular) on 4th November 2019, for prophylaxis.   Co-suspect products included Mmr Ii for prophylaxis.   Concurrent medical conditions included upper respiratory tract infection.   On 17th November 2019 20:00, 13 days after receiving Bexsero vs Placebo co-administered with PCV and routine vaccines, the subject developed severe - grade 3 febrile seizure. Serious criteria included clinically significant/intervention required. The outcome of febrile seizure was recovered/resolved on 17th November 2019 20:03.   The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the febrile seizure may have been caused by Bexsero vs Placebo co-administered with PCV and routine vaccines.   Other possible cause(s) of the febrile seizure included concurrent medication MMR II  and medical condition upper respiratory tract infection.   INVESTIGATOR TEXT Subject reported a temperature of 100.7F in their e_Diary the evening of 17Nov2019 and then subject experienced a febrile seizure (not tonic-clonic, simply blank stare and unresponsiveness for 2 to 3 minutes). Subject did not go to the emergency room for this but did have a visit with the PCP on 18Nov2019. According to the PCP's exam, subject has an upper respiratory infection. It is not known definitively if the fever and associated febrile seizure was a result of the URI or a reaction to MMR vaccination (timing of reaction falls with in parameters of a possible reaction to MMR vaccine). - Single febrile seizure - related to - MMR II;  This case contains an event assessed by the investigator as a serious Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI).

progressed to rigors, developed a  migraine 6 to 8 hours after fatigue, insomnia, temp was 100.4. Those symptoms progressed and stayed stable for 24 hours until the next night and didn't resolve until the 18th and  late that night I developed lymphadenopathy in left axilla, al nodes very swollen and large. That subsided since then. I took Tylenol and 10mg Rizatriptan  for migraines  and that resolved. **I was in a double blinded study for the AstraZeneca trial and am still unsure whether or not I received the placebo or the actual shot.

after receiving the vaccine patient who is a L&D Nurse return to work in her area. She describes that after finishing with a C-section she felt burning in both of her eyes (she thought this feels like an allergic reaction, but I am not sweating and haven't rubbed my eyes). She went to the restroom to get a cloth to wash her eyes; afterwards she reports her vision went totally black in both eyes. She reports feeling frustrated that no one came to help and some panic in trying to figure out how to get out of the restroom. She did make it out of the bathroom. Her Staff reports she postured and turned arms inward, head going to one side and passed out. They also report ~ 10 minutes of incoherent conversation and stating \"I got the vaccine, maybe I was given the wrong thing and now I'm blind\". Upon waking, patient vision fully restored and patient does not remember incoherent conversation.

This case has been considered invalid as non-serious event was not reportable in clinical study.   This is a report from an interventional study.  A 51-year-old female non-pregnant subject received blinded therapy (BNT162; PLACEBO) first dose on 24Aug2020 at 13:15 and second dose on 15Sep2020, via an unspecified route of administration on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to some foods.  No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The subject experienced bell's palsy on 03Dec2020 which considered as non-serious by investigator. Clinical course was as follows: on 03Dec2020, the subject had a diagnosis of bell's palsy post 2nd vaccine. The subject had no COVID prior vaccination. A nasal swab post vaccination on 30Nov2020 was negative.  After visit 3 (13Oct2020), the subject reported the Bell's Palsy. She went to her doctor, but mot hospitalized. The investigator did not think this was an SAE and was not considered life threatening. The action taken in response to the event for blinded therapy was not applicable. Event treatment included an unspecified medication. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  The investigator assessment with blinded therapy, concomitant drugs and clinical trial procedure not reported.  Follow-up (21Dec2020): New information received from site included: updated report type, patient ID, event seriousness (non-serious).  \n","69423

No information was provided regarding medical history, concurrent conditions, or concomitant medications. On or around 17-OCT-2017, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (exact dose, dose number, route and site of administration, lot# and expiration date were not reported), for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). On an unknown date, shortly after receiving the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient suffered an acute onset of left eye vision loss. The patient was admitted to the hospital and she was ultimately diagnosed with central retinal artery occlusion of the left eye and was completely blind in her left eye, at the reporting time. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) use, the patient's symptoms had resulted in physical limitations not present prior to vaccination. The patient also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitation and seriousness of her condition. As a result of the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) use, the patient sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, as a tragic consequence of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) use, the patient suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. The outcome of the event was reported as not recovered. The relatedness between the event and zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) was reported as related.

Her symptoms began 2 weeks following intradermal influenza vaccination. Fundus examination and diagnostic testing were consistent with MEWDS. This is a report of MEWDS following intradermal influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination is recommended for the elderly, pregnant, and patients with asthma, in addition to other high-risk groups. During the 2015-2016 flu season, over 146 million doses were distributed.2 Influenza vaccination is safe, widely administered, and welltolerated with minor side effects including localized swelling at the injection site, arthralgias, and low-grade fevers. Serious side effects are very rare. The risk of autoimmune phenomenon following flu vaccination is a debated topic.3 Multiple Evanescent White-Dot Syndrome is predominantly unilateral and is more commonly seen in young myopic women.4 Several small (100-200 micrometers) discrete white lesions are witnessed deep in the retina or situated at level of the retinal pigment epithelium. The lesions are concentrated in the posterior pole, primarily in the perifoveal region, while sparing the fovea. The lesions are characterized by early hyperfluorescence and late staining on fluorescein angiography. A granular appearance to the macula is also seen with irregularity of the internal limiting membrane reflex.   This case involves a 27 years old female patient who experienced multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (retinal exudates), confrontation visual field test revealed central loss in the right eye and full visual field in the left eye (central vision loss), anterior vitreous inflammation of oculus dextrus (OD) (iridocyclitis), retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) irregularities (retinal pigment epitheliopathy), central flashing lights in her right eye, photopsia of oculus dextrus (OD) (photopsia), nonpigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole (chorioretinal scar) and enlarged blind spot in the right eye (visual field defect), while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  The patient's medical history included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Vesicoureteric reflux, Endometriosis, fibroadenomas, Depression, Tonsillectomy and Vesicoureteral reflux surgery. The patient's past medical treatment included ATENOLOL with 25 milligram one a day and CENTRUM PLUS with one a day. The patient's past vaccination(s) and family history were not provided. At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing Chronic kidney disease, allergies to multiple antibiotics and Non-tobacco user.   On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via intradermal route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (retinal exudates), confrontation visual field test revealed central loss in the right eye and full visual field in the left eye (central vision loss), anterior vitreous inflammation of oculus dextrus (OD) (iridocyclitis) and retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) irregularities (retinal pigment epitheliopathy) (Unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. These events was assessed as medically significant. On an unknown date, the patient developed a non-serious central flashing lights in her right eye, photopsia of oculus dextrus (OD) (photopsia), two weeks following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. On an unknown date, the patient developed a non-serious nonpigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole (chorioretinal scar) and enlarged blind spot in the right eye (visual field defect) (Unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Relevant laboratory test results included Fluorescence angiogram abnormal, Intraocular pressure test: 12 mmHg visual acuity tests : 20/25-2 OD unit and [20/20 OS] and visual field tests done on an unknown date.  (Other relevant tests included Pupillary reaction, motility, and adnexa exam were unremarkable. A Confrontation Visual Field test revealed central loss in the right eye and full visual field in the left eye.  Fundus examination of the right eye revealed scattered non-pigmented deep retinal or chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole. The optic nerve appeared normal.  Fluorescein Angiography of the right eye showed multiple round lesions in the posterior pole with early hyper-fluorescence and late staining  Fundus examination OS was normal. Humphrey visual field testing revealed an enlarged blind spot in the right eye. The macular lesions on exam had resolved with mild residual RPE mottling.  She did not report any symptoms from her left eye. And she did not drink. A comprehensive review of systems was negative for fever, rash, oral ulcers, arthralgias, headache, or vertigo. There was no history of recent viral illness. Pupillary reaction, motility, and adnexa exam were unremarkable. The optic nerve appeared normal. Fundus examination OS was normal.  Final diagnosis was retinal exudates, central vision loss, iridocyclitis, retinal pigment epitheliopathy, photopsia, chorioretinal scar and visual field defect.   No corrective treatment was received.  The patient was recovering from the events.  Vaccines work by exposing the immune system to specific pathogenic features that prime the immune response through adaptive immunity as well as cellular memory. Excessive lymphocyte activation, abnormal cytokine expression, and molecular mimicry are several possible mechanisms that could potentially play a role in the development of autoimmune phenomena following vaccination.  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 27 years old female patient who presented with retinal exudates, central vision loss, iridocyclitis, retinal pigment epitheliopathy, photopsia, chorioretinal scar and visual field defect after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE. Time to onset is compatible for photopsia and unknown for other events. Patients medical condition at the time of vaccination was Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Vesicoureteric reflux, Endometriosis, fibroadenomas, Depression, Tonsillectomy and Vesicoureteral reflux surgery and tests showed abnormal Fluorescence angiogram. Based upon the reported information, the role of the vaccine cannot be assessed.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4654</th>\n","      <td>858673</td>\n","      <td>Extreme pain Hallucinating Psychogenic non epileptic seizures Temporary blindness Muscle tensing</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5342</th>\n","      <td>860197</td>\n","      <td>vision loss; Graves' disease; Graves' ophthalmopathy; double vision; tremors; fatigue; tachycardia; increased anxiety; This initial spontaneous report was received from a lawyer regarding a case in litigation and refers to a female patient of unspecified age.

A 29-year-old male was diagnosed with lichen planus after the administration of all the three doses of the blinded study drug.  Study drug administration dates:  06MAY2019: Dose 1 20MAY2019: Dose 2 03JUN2019: Dose 3  On 06MAY2019, the subject received the first dose of the blinded study drug. After two weeks, on 20MAY2019, he received the second dose, and on 03JUN2019, he received his last dose of the study drug.   On 22NOV2019, 172 days after the last dose, he presented to the clinic with chief complaints of rash and red bumps on his hands, forearms, and shins ongoing since two weeks. Rash was located on his wrist, going up to his arms and shoulders. His bumps were somewhat itchy and resembled bug bites. Rashes appeared as blisters and flaky spots. No one else in his house had a rash or similar bumps. He denied fever, pets in the home, history of eczema or asthma. On the same day, his vital sign measurement showed a body mass index (BMI) of 35.8 kg/m2, blood pressure was 118/79 mmHg, temperature was 97.4 F, heart rate was 87 beats per minute and oxygen saturation was 97 %. Physical examination revealed skin with multiple scattered erythematous papules on the dorsal hands, volar wrists, forearms and anterior lower legs. He was administered dexamethasone sodium phosphate Injection Solution and Depo-medrol (methylprednisolone acetate) injection. He was also advised to start triamcinolone acetonide external cream for topical application and Zyrtec, and to follow up if the symptoms persist or worsen.  On 09DEC2019, he came for follow up visit with continued red and itchy bumps on his wrists, forearms and shins. He had been using topical triamcinolone as prescribed without any improvement. He denied fever, chest pain, shortness of breath or any family member with similar symptoms. The rash was not always bothersome or itchy, but it did not improve. He was advised to continue using triamcinolone for two weeks, followed by interruption for a week and then restart as required. He was encouraged to continue good skin care.  On 16DEC2019, he presented again for a follow-up due to a persistent rash. Despite oral, injection, and topical steroids, there was not much improvement. Physical examination revealed 1 mm to 10 mm round to linear red papules, vesicles, and scaly patches on volar wrists, forearms, shoulders, and shins. A shave biopsy of a right arm lesion confirmed lichen planus. Microscopic examination revealed acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis. Sub-epidermal vesicle formation was present associated with underlying acute and chronic in?ammation which obscured the dermal-epidermal junction. There was no evidence of malignancy.   Medical history included environmental and seasonal allergies and wisdom tooth extraction. Also had a positive history of blistering sunburns and denied history of psoriasis and eczema. There was no personal or family history of skin cancer.  Family history included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (maternal grandmother) and rheumatoid arthritis (maternal grandfather).  Outcome: The subject had not recovered at the time of report.   The Investigator assessed the event lichen planus to be possibly related to therapy with study drug.  Medical Monitor assessed the event as unexpected and possibly related to study product administration. It is not possible to exclude causality at this time due to the event being reported post-enrolment in the study, even though the immuno-stimulatory effect of CPG is transient as demonstrated by clinical studies. The subject last received study product about six months prior to the onset of the event. Though the etiology of lichen planus is currently unknown, no cases have been reported in other clinical studies involving higher doses of CPG 7909 when used as monotherapy, in combination with anti-cancer therapies or as vaccine adjuvants. Thus, there is currently no known association between CPG 7909 and lichen planus.  The case was reviewed by the Board on 09MAR2020: The Physician indicated the diagnosis might be possible related, even given the time lapse.  Company Assessment: The Company assessed the event as possibly related.

A 41-year-old female was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) approximately 1 month after the third dose of the blinded study drug.  Study drug administration dates: 10MAY2019: Dose 1 24MAY2019: Dose 2 07JUN2019: Dose 3  The subject received the first dose of study product on 10MAY2020 (Day 1).  Day 1 baseline labs revealed a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a titer of 1:40 and a rheumatoid factor (RF) titer of 10 IU/mL (ref range is 0-14 IU/mL).  On 24MAY2019 (Day 15), the subject she was informed of her laboratory results in detail.  She agreed to continue with study treatment per protocol and received the second dose on the same day.  On 07JUN2019 (Day 29), though not part of routine testing, the PI requested a repeat ANA test considering the initial positive outcome.  The repeat test was positive at 1:40 (unchanged from the Day 1).  She was instructed to follow-up with rheumatology due to the positive results.  On the same day, she received her last dose of the study drug.   On 12JUL2019 (Day 64), an ANA test showed an increase to 1:80 with the RF titer remaining consistent with Day 1 labs (10 IU/ml).  She was informed of her result.  The subject stated she had visited a Rheumatologist, but she was unsure about her diagnosis. She was not taking any medication at that time.    The subject was requested to visit the site for the Day 302 visit.  During the visit, she informed the Sub-Investigator of a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was taking Sulfasalazine and Meloxicam.   Subsequently on 05MAR2020, repeat laboratory testing was performed.  Results are pending at the time of this report.  Medical records have been requested.   Outcome: The subject had not recovered at the time of report.   Concomitant therapy included Radiance (drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol) for birth control.    The action taken with study drug was not applicable as the rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed after the last dose of study drug.   The Investigator assessed the event of grade 1 (mild) rheumatoid arthritis to be possibly related to therapy with study drug.  Medical Monitor assessed the event as unexpected and unrelated to the study products, based on the currently available information. The assessment may change if redacted medical records are received substantiating the diagnosis and it's justification. This event is unexpected and unrelated based on the fact that subject is said to be asymptomatic, and pre-vaccination &amp; post-vaccination (Day 64) RF titers were 10 IU/mL and 10 IU/ml respectively within normal limits (0-14 IU/mL). BUN and creatinine were also within normal limits at Day 1 and 29. Though there was some increase in ANA titer from 1:40 to 1:80 from pre-vaccination to Day 64, this is not enough to substantiate this diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.  A preliminary assessment by a member of the safety board indicated the RF is normal, but the diagnosis of RA is also based upon cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints on exam.  As a result, this assessment may change based on the results of anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) pre- and post-vaccination and redacted medical records  Company Comment: The Company assessed the event as not related to exposure with the blinded study product.  The assessment is based up the following:  there is no confirmed diagnosis, the subject is asymptomatic, ANA positive tests alone are not indicative alone, RF titer was negative, and lack of objective physical exam findings.  Medical records have been requested to confirm by objective evidence of additional testing/physical examination.; Sender's Comments: The Company assessed the event as not related to exposure with the blinded study product.

The patient received Shingrix and did not realize the 2nd dose vaccine appointment for the trial was a week later, so the patient had to push back the 2nd dose by a month, so they could wait for the shingles vaccine to take effects. The shingles vaccine was a terrible vaccine, painful and had severe reaction to them because it was injected into the muscle. The patient was sick as dog for few days. The vaccine was miserable, but was a believer in vaccine. No further information was provided. The patient reported that the study he was in, was a double-blind study, so the patient did not know for sure if received the vaccine or not, but he believes he received the vaccine because he had reactions, but they were not terrible.  The patient arm hurt for week after and was not bad and it was far less painful than the shingles vaccine was horrible. Then he had a fever a couple of times for a couple days and he did not feel ill. It's also unusual for him to get a fever for anything, and if he did not it's usually a retrograde fever. There was some swelling in his arm and some red spots, for about a week. It was particularly the pain and swelling and usually he did not get reaction to vaccines, except for the shingles vaccine.  No further information provided. The patient reported over the phone that when he had the third dose of vaccine, he had problems with severe fatigue. He was sleeping constantly. One night, he slept for 14 hrs. or some ridiculous amount. And that was the week following the injection. He noted on the trial application the different symptoms and put down he had a severe problem last night, and the doctor called him the next morning because Pfizer contacted them.  The doctor said he heard the patient had trouble sleeping. The patient told the doctor that he did not think it was related to vaccine. Another doctor changed a medication, and he has severe sleep disorders, so the patient said he was not concerned. No further information provided.

This case is linked to cases 2020SA001262, 2020SA001225, 2020SA001235 and 2020SA001250 (Same reporter).  The following is verbatim from the article:  Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017.  Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years.  Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), respiratory failure (respiratory failure) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided.  Concomitant medications included AMOXICILLIN SODIUM (AMOXICILLIN [AMOXICILLIN SODIUM]).  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIVALENT produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed serious Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) 3 days following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. The patient was died due to respiratory failure (respiratory failure) on an unspecified date. All events was assessed as medically significant.  It is unknown if an autopsy was done.  Details of laboratory data not reported.  Final diagnosis was toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and respiratory failure  It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The outcome of the events toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome was unknown at the time of reporting.   There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced toxic epidermal necrolysis, respiratory failure, Stevens Johnson syndrome and reported (fatal) death after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer. The time to onset is compatible with the role of vaccine. Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Additional information regarding condition at the time of vaccination, lab data excluding other etiologies and detailed autopsy report would be needed for complete assessment of the case. Based upon the reported information, the role of vaccine cannot be assessed.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: respiratory failure   \n","705    Death NOS; toxic epidermal necrolysis; desquamation of 8090% of BSA; Initial information received on 31-DEC-2019 regarding an unsolicited valid serious literature case.

The following is verbatim from the article:  Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017.  Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years.  Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), respiratory failure (respiratory failure) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided.  Concomitant medications included AMOXICILLIN SODIUM (AMOXICILLIN [AMOXICILLIN SODIUM]).  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIVALENT produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed serious Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) 3 days following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. The patient was died due to respiratory failure (respiratory failure) on an unspecified date. All events was assessed as medically significant.  It is unknown if an autopsy was done.  Details of laboratory data not reported.  Final diagnosis was toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and respiratory failure  It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The outcome of the events toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome was unknown at the time of reporting.   There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced toxic epidermal necrolysis, respiratory failure, Stevens Johnson syndrome and reported (fatal) death after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer. The time to onset is compatible with the role of vaccine. Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Additional information regarding condition at the time of vaccination, lab data excluding other etiologies and detailed autopsy report would be needed for complete assessment of the case.

The following is verbatim from the article:  Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017. Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017.

Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 71 years old male patient who experienced toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) and later died (death NOS), while he received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIVALENT.  Medical treatment, vaccination and family history were not provided.  At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing Plasma cell myeloma, Rheumatic heart disease and Gout.  Concomitant medications included Allopurinol for Gout.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIVALENT (produced by unknown manufacturer) (lot number and other dosing details were not reported) via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) and desquamation of 80-90% of body surface area (skin exfoliation), one day following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT). These events were assessed as medically significant.  On an unknown date, the patient died (death), following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT). This event was assessed as medically significant and was leading to death.   Details of laboratory data not reported.  Final diagnosis was severe skin exfoliation and severe toxic epidermal necrolysis and death NOS.  It was unknown if an autopsy was done. The cause of death was not reported.

information received on 31-DEC-2019 regarding an unsolicited valid serious literature case.   This case is linked to cases 2020SA001262, 2020SA001225, 2020SA001235 and 2020SA001250 (Same reporter).  The following is verbatim from the article:  Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017.  Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years.  Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), respiratory failure (respiratory failure) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided.  Concomitant medications included AMOXICILLIN SODIUM (AMOXICILLIN [AMOXICILLIN SODIUM]).  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIVALENT produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed serious Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) 3 days following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. The patient was died due to respiratory failure (respiratory failure) on an unspecified date. All events was assessed as medically significant.  It is unknown if an autopsy was done.  Details of laboratory data not reported.  Final diagnosis was toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and respiratory failure  It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The outcome of the events toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome was unknown at the time of reporting.   There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced toxic epidermal necrolysis, respiratory failure, Stevens Johnson syndrome and reported (fatal) death after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer. The time to onset is compatible with the role of vaccine. Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Additional information regarding condition at the time of vaccination, lab data excluding other etiologies and detailed autopsy report would be needed for complete assessment of the case. Based upon the reported information, the role of vaccine cannot be assessed.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: respiratory failure  \n","705    Death NOS; toxic epidermal necrolysis; desquamation of 8090% of BSA; Initial information received on 31-DEC-2019 regarding an unsolicited valid serious literature case.

The following is verbatim from the article:  Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017.  Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years.  Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), respiratory failure (respiratory failure) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia. Medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided.  Concomitant medications included AMOXICILLIN SODIUM (AMOXICILLIN [AMOXICILLIN SODIUM]).  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIVALENT produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed serious Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) 3 days following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. The patient was died due to respiratory failure (respiratory failure) on an unspecified date. All events was assessed as medically significant.  It is unknown if an autopsy was done.  Details of laboratory data not reported.  Final diagnosis was toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and respiratory failure  It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The outcome of the events toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome was unknown at the time of reporting.   There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced toxic epidermal necrolysis, respiratory failure, Stevens Johnson syndrome and reported (fatal) death after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer. The time to onset is compatible with the role of vaccine. Medical history included Post herpetic neuralgia.
