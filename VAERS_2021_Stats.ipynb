About a day after getting the vaccine, the kidney infection significantly  increased, I started having spots of blood come out of my urine tract, had a fever of 102.6 F for a couple days before my wife convinced me to go the the clinic.   They diagnosed it , gave me antibiotics  and it quickly cleared up.  The booster seems to have triggered the infection to get significantly  worse.   \n",

              "781597  She had a stroke on April 1st, 2021 while at the Nurse's office, according to my mom & symptoms. She died on April 23rd as a result. Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses & medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine & shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.   \n",

Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses &amp; medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine &amp; shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.</td>\n",

              "1049455  She had a stroke on April 1st, 2021 while at the Nurse's office, according to my mom & symptoms. She died on April 23rd as a result. Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses & medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine & shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.   \n",

Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses &amp; medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine &amp; shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.</td>\n",

Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.</td>\n",

Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses &amp; medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine &amp; shot stroke may be related.

case was missing the following minimum criteria: no adverse effect. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 24Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid. This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP. A 58-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ej1685), via intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 14:45 at first single dose, via intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 15:00 at second single dose (pending to clarify), for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19, high blood pressure (BP) and high cholesterol and myocarditis. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No known allergies. 24 hours after receiving the first vaccine (23Dec2020 16:00), the patient experienced chills fever body aches and fatigue. The events were non-serious.

my arm hurt. The next day (1/5/21) the body aches and nausea started. I wasn't worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn't prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.   \n",

Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

booster; fainted; fever; chills; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable reporter(s) (Pharmacist) from medical information team.  A 17 year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) (Batch/Lot number: unknown) at the age of 17 years as dose 3 (booster), single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient's relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (DOSE 1, SINGLE), for Covid-19 immunization; Bnt162b2 (DOSE 2, SINGLE), for Covid-19 immunization. The following information was reported: IMMUNISATION (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"booster\"; SYNCOPE (medically significant), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"fainted\"; PYREXIA (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"fever\"; CHILLS (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"chills\". The events \"booster\", \"fainted\", \"fever\" and \"chills\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course: The reporter (Pharmacist) stated that her son got Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 Booster dose and had fever and chills but subsequently he fainted. The patient was then taken to ER. The reporter said, had read all the information regarding myocarditis in the PI and asks if information from the trials regarding within how many days after the vaccine dose did myocarditis happened. The reporter asked if encountered this problem with a particular lot of Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccines.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events immunization and syncope and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                   About a month after the 2nd dose, I started having a pain in my chest. The doctor thought it might be anxiety so it was treated as such but it kept getting worse. Around Thanksgiving I thought I was having an attack of some kind even though I?d never had heart problems in the past. I called the doctor and was scheduled immediately for a gallbladder ultrasound, EKG, and lab work. The EKG revealed a right bundle branch block that has a known cause of myocarditis. I am under the care of a cardiologist currently and have more tests scheduled this week.   \n",

                   About a month after the 2nd dose, I started having a pain in my chest. The doctor thought it might be anxiety so it was treated as such but it kept getting worse. Around Thanksgiving I thought I was having an attack of some kind even though I?d never had heart problems in the past. I called the doctor and was scheduled immediately for a gallbladder ultrasound, EKG, and lab work. The EKG revealed a right bundle branch block that has a known cause of myocarditis. I am under the care of a cardiologist currently and have more tests scheduled this week.   \n",

The reporter is the patient.  A 70 year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), administered in arm left, administration date 20Mar2021 in midday (Lot number: EN6205) at the age of 70 years as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (Dose:1, Time: Around midday, Anatomical location: left arm, Lot: EN6203, Expiration: Jun2021), administration date: 27Feb2021, when the patient was 70 years old, for Covid-19 immunization, reaction(s): \"high blood pressure/She states her blood pressure will go up to 220, 198, 183/I was in excellent health; I didn't had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof\". The following information was reported: HYPERTENSION (medically significant) with onset Apr2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul\"; EYE HAEMORRHAGE (medically significant) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\"; PERIPHERAL SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"her feet were swollen\"; JOINT SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she could not see her ankles\". The event \"blood pressure stayed in apr, in may, in jun, in jul\" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The events \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\", \"her feet were swollen\" and \"she could not see her ankles\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles.

The reporter is the patient.  A 70 year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), administered in arm left, administration date 20Mar2021 in midday (Lot number: EN6205) at the age of 70 years as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (Dose:1, Time: Around midday, Anatomical location: left arm, Lot: EN6203, Expiration: Jun2021), administration date: 27Feb2021, when the patient was 70 years old, for Covid-19 immunization, reaction(s): \"high blood pressure/She states her blood pressure will go up to 220, 198, 183/I was in excellent health; I didn't had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof\". The following information was reported: HYPERTENSION (medically significant) with onset Apr2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul\"; EYE HAEMORRHAGE (medically significant) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\"; PERIPHERAL SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"her feet were swollen\"; JOINT SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she could not see her ankles\". The event \"blood pressure stayed in apr, in may, in jun, in jul\" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The events \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\", \"her feet were swollen\" and \"she could not see her ankles\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

my arm hurt. The next day (1/5/21) the body aches and nausea started. I wasn't worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn't prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.   \n",

dyspnea. Symptoms began around 12/29. COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his \"deconditioning\" in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.   \n",

received from contactable reporter(s) (Other HCP). The reporter is the patient.  A 19 year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), administered in arm right, administration date 15Dec2021 12:15 (Lot number: 33130BA) at the age of 19 years as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient's relevant medical history was not reported. Covid prior vaccination: no. There were no concomitant medications. Other medications in two weeks: no. Other vaccine in four weeks: no. Past drug history included: Ibuprofen, reaction(s): \"Allergy\". Other medical history: nothing. The following information was reported: MYOCARDITIS (medically significant), CARDIAC DISORDER (non-serious) all with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\" and all described as \"Heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\"; FIBRIN D DIMER INCREASED (non-serious) with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\", described as \"D-dimer levels were high\"; ASTHENIA (non-serious) with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\", described as \"I feel weak\". Ever since the shot she had experienced heart complications. The patient was taken to the hospital, completed blood work, urine specimen, iodine test because D-dimer levels were high, no blood clot but had inflammation around her heart and she felt weak and on a heart monitor now. The events \"heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\", \"heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\", \"d-dimer levels were high\" and \"i feel weak\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood test: (16Dec2021) unknown results; cardiac monitoring: (16Dec2021) unknown results; fibrin d dimer: (16Dec2021) high, notes: No blood clot; investigation: (16Dec2021) unknown results; urine analysis: (16Dec2021) unknown results. Covid tested post vaccination: No. Therapeutic measures were not taken as a result of myocarditis, cardiac disorder, fibrin d dimer increased, asthenia.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information available, the causal relationship between the reported events and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

The following information was reported: HYPERTENSION (medically significant) with onset Apr2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul\"; EYE HAEMORRHAGE (medically significant) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\"; PERIPHERAL SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"her feet were swollen\"; JOINT SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she could not see her ankles\". The event \"blood pressure stayed in apr, in may, in jun, in jul\" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The events \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\", \"her feet were swollen\" and \"she could not see her ankles\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

booster; fainted; fever; chills; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable reporter(s) (Pharmacist) from medical information team.  A 17 year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) (Batch/Lot number: unknown) at the age of 17 years as dose 3 (booster), single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient's relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (DOSE 1, SINGLE), for Covid-19 immunization; Bnt162b2 (DOSE 2, SINGLE), for Covid-19 immunization. The following information was reported: IMMUNISATION (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"booster\"; SYNCOPE (medically significant), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"fainted\"; PYREXIA (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"fever\"; CHILLS (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"chills\". The events \"booster\", \"fainted\", \"fever\" and \"chills\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course: The reporter (Pharmacist) stated that her son got Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 Booster dose and had fever and chills but subsequently he fainted. The patient was then taken to ER. The reporter said, had read all the information regarding myocarditis in the PI and asks if information from the trials regarding within how many days after the vaccine dose did myocarditis happened. The reporter asked if encountered this problem with a particular lot of Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccines.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events immunization and syncope and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.   \n",

                   About a month after the 2nd dose, I started having a pain in my chest. The doctor thought it might be anxiety so it was treated as such but it kept getting worse. Around Thanksgiving I thought I was having an attack of some kind even though I?d never had heart problems in the past. I called the doctor and was scheduled immediately for a gallbladder ultrasound, EKG, and lab work. The EKG revealed a right bundle branch block that has a known cause of myocarditis. I am under the care of a cardiologist currently and have more tests scheduled this week.   \n",

There is linear mid myocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the inferoseptal wall of the left ventricle in a nonischemic pattern. This may represent sequela of myocarditis.  Findings do not appear to be acute. 2. The left ventricle is dilated with global hypokinesis and significantly reduced LV systolic function. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 25%. There is also diastolic dysfunction. 3. The right systolic function is also reduced with ejection fraction of 30%. 4. There is a moderate-sized pericardial effusion without evidence of pericarditis or constrictive physiology.   CT chest 1/8: 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.  Mild cardiomegaly with small/moderate-sized pericardial effusion that appears mildly increased in size from the earlier abdominal CT. There are findings of mild pulmonary edema which are greatest in the lung bases and are new from the earlier abdominal CT. 3.

Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his \"deconditioning\" in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.</td>\n",

The patient's relevant medical history was not reported. Covid prior vaccination: no. There were no concomitant medications. Other medications in two weeks: no. Other vaccine in four weeks: no. Past drug history included: Ibuprofen, reaction(s): \"Allergy\". Other medical history: nothing. The following information was reported: MYOCARDITIS (medically significant), CARDIAC DISORDER (non-serious) all with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\" and all described as \"Heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\"; FIBRIN D DIMER INCREASED (non-serious) with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\", described as \"D-dimer levels were high\"; ASTHENIA (non-serious) with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\", described as \"I feel weak\". Ever since the shot she had experienced heart complications. The patient was taken to the hospital, completed blood work, urine specimen, iodine test because D-dimer levels were high, no blood clot but had inflammation around her heart and she felt weak and on a heart monitor now. The events \"heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\", \"heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\", \"d-dimer levels were high\" and \"i feel weak\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood test: (16Dec2021) unknown results; cardiac monitoring: (16Dec2021) unknown results; fibrin d dimer: (16Dec2021) high, notes: No blood clot; investigation: (16Dec2021) unknown results; urine analysis: (16Dec2021) unknown results. Covid tested post vaccination: No. Therapeutic measures were not taken as a result of myocarditis, cardiac disorder, fibrin d dimer increased, asthenia.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information available, the causal relationship between the reported events and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

The reporter is the patient.  A 70 year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), administered in arm left, administration date 20Mar2021 in midday (Lot number: EN6205) at the age of 70 years as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (Dose:1, Time: Around midday, Anatomical location: left arm, Lot: EN6203, Expiration: Jun2021), administration date: 27Feb2021, when the patient was 70 years old, for Covid-19 immunization, reaction(s): \"high blood pressure/She states her blood pressure will go up to 220, 198, 183/I was in excellent health; I didn't had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof\". The following information was reported: HYPERTENSION (medically significant) with onset Apr2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul\"; EYE HAEMORRHAGE (medically significant) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\"; PERIPHERAL SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"her feet were swollen\"; JOINT SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she could not see her ankles\". The event \"blood pressure stayed in apr, in may, in jun, in jul\" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The events \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\", \"her feet were swollen\" and \"she could not see her ankles\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

Around Thanksgiving I thought I was having an attack of some kind even though I?d never had heart problems in the past. I called the doctor and was scheduled immediately for a gallbladder ultrasound, EKG, and lab work. The EKG revealed a right bundle branch block that has a known cause of myocarditis.

case was missing the following minimum criteria: no adverse effect. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 24Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid. This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP. A 58-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ej1685), via intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 14:45 at first single dose, via intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 15:00 at second single dose (pending to clarify), for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19, high blood pressure (BP) and high cholesterol and myocarditis. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No known allergies. 24 hours after receiving the first vaccine (23Dec2020 16:00), the patient experienced chills fever body aches and fatigue. The events were non-serious. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. No treatment received for the events.

my arm hurt. The next day (1/5/21) the body aches and nausea started. I wasn't worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn't prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.  \n",

dyspnea. Symptoms began around 12/29. COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his \"deconditioning\" in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.  \n",

received from contactable reporter(s) (Other HCP). The reporter is the patient.  A 19 year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), administered in arm right, administration date 15Dec2021 12:15 (Lot number: 33130BA) at the age of 19 years as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient's relevant medical history was not reported. Covid prior vaccination: no. There were no concomitant medications. Other medications in two weeks: no. Other vaccine in four weeks: no. Past drug history included: Ibuprofen, reaction(s): \"Allergy\". Other medical history: nothing. The following information was reported: MYOCARDITIS (medically significant), CARDIAC DISORDER (non-serious) all with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\" and all described as \"Heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\"; FIBRIN D DIMER INCREASED (non-serious) with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\", described as \"D-dimer levels were high\"; ASTHENIA (non-serious) with onset 16Dec2021, outcome \"not recovered\", described as \"I feel weak\". Ever since the shot she had experienced heart complications. The patient was taken to the hospital, completed blood work, urine specimen, iodine test because D-dimer levels were high, no blood clot but had inflammation around her heart and she felt weak and on a heart monitor now. The events \"heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\", \"heart complications/have inflammation around my heart\", \"d-dimer levels were high\" and \"i feel weak\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood test: (16Dec2021) unknown results; cardiac monitoring: (16Dec2021) unknown results; fibrin d dimer: (16Dec2021) high, notes: No blood clot; investigation: (16Dec2021) unknown results; urine analysis: (16Dec2021) unknown results. Covid tested post vaccination: No. Therapeutic measures were not taken as a result of myocarditis, cardiac disorder, fibrin d dimer increased, asthenia.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information available, the causal relationship between the reported events and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

The following information was reported: HYPERTENSION (medically significant) with onset Apr2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul\"; EYE HAEMORRHAGE (medically significant) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\"; PERIPHERAL SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"her feet were swollen\"; JOINT SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she could not see her ankles\". The event \"blood pressure stayed in apr, in may, in jun, in jul\" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The events \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\", \"her feet were swollen\" and \"she could not see her ankles\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

booster; fainted; fever; chills; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable reporter(s) (Pharmacist) from medical information team.  A 17 year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) (Batch/Lot number: unknown) at the age of 17 years as dose 3 (booster), single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient's relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (DOSE 1, SINGLE), for Covid-19 immunization; Bnt162b2 (DOSE 2, SINGLE), for Covid-19 immunization. The following information was reported: IMMUNISATION (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"booster\"; SYNCOPE (medically significant), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"fainted\"; PYREXIA (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"fever\"; CHILLS (non-serious), outcome \"unknown\", described as \"chills\". The events \"booster\", \"fainted\", \"fever\" and \"chills\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course: The reporter (Pharmacist) stated that her son got Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 Booster dose and had fever and chills but subsequently he fainted. The patient was then taken to ER. The reporter said, had read all the information regarding myocarditis in the PI and asks if information from the trials regarding within how many days after the vaccine dose did myocarditis happened. The reporter asked if encountered this problem with a particular lot of Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccines.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events immunization and syncope and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.  \n",

                   About a month after the 2nd dose, I started having a pain in my chest. The doctor thought it might be anxiety so it was treated as such but it kept getting worse. Around Thanksgiving I thought I was having an attack of some kind even though I?d never had heart problems in the past. I called the doctor and was scheduled immediately for a gallbladder ultrasound, EKG, and lab work. The EKG revealed a right bundle branch block that has a known cause of myocarditis. I am under the care of a cardiologist currently and have more tests scheduled this week.  \n",

While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his \"deconditioning\" in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.</td>\n",

A 70 year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), administered in arm left, administration date 20Mar2021 in midday (Lot number: EN6205) at the age of 70 years as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (Dose:1, Time: Around midday, Anatomical location: left arm, Lot: EN6203, Expiration: Jun2021), administration date: 27Feb2021, when the patient was 70 years old, for Covid-19 immunization, reaction(s): \"high blood pressure/She states her blood pressure will go up to 220, 198, 183/I was in excellent health; I didn't had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof\". The following information was reported: HYPERTENSION (medically significant) with onset Apr2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul\"; EYE HAEMORRHAGE (medically significant) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\"; PERIPHERAL SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"her feet were swollen\"; JOINT SWELLING (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"she could not see her ankles\". The event \"blood pressure stayed in apr, in may, in jun, in jul\" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The events \"she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke\", \"her feet were swollen\" and \"she could not see her ankles\" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, \"I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?\" The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood pressure measurement: (2021) 220, notes: blood pressure went up to 220; (2021) 193, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 185, notes: her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185; (2021) 179, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 175, notes: blood pressure was still high like 179, 175; (2021) 150, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 160, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 140, notes: my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140; (2021) 180, notes: it still can be 180, 195; (2021) 195, notes: it still can be 180, 195; blood test: (2021) normal; colonoscopy: (2021) unknown results; electrocardiogram: (2021) normal; urine analysis: (2021) normal.

About a week later, patient tested positive for COVID 19.  She had a number of chronic, underlying health conditions.  The vaccine did not have enough time to prevent COVID 19.  There is no evidence that the vaccination caused patient's death.  It simply didn't have time to save her life.   \n",

              "1049454  She had a stroke on April 1st, 2021 while at the Nurse's office, according to my mom & symptoms. She died on April 23rd as a result. Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses & medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine & shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.   \n",

The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine & shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.   \n",

Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses &amp; medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine &amp; shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.</td>\n",

Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses &amp; medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine &amp; shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.</td>\n",

About a week later, patient tested positive for COVID 19.  She had a number of chronic, underlying health conditions.  The vaccine did not have enough time to prevent COVID 19.  There is no evidence that the vaccination caused patient's death.  It simply didn't have time to save her life.  \n",

              "1049437  The adverse events being reported and documented below are death from unexplained spontaneous bleeding (thinning of the blood) that followed acute inflammation and excruciating pain that began less than 48 hours after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine.Timeline of events from March 4 - May 2, 2021; 3/4/21  - Second dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine received. 3/5/21  - Mom) reported being very tired and nauseous. 3/6/21  - (Mom) reported being in extreme pain which turned into excruciating pain. Timeline of events from March 4 - May 2, 2021  Note:  (Mom) had a very high tolerance for pain, evidenced by previous major falls & fractured bones (pelvis, hip, both femurs, 9 ribs, 3 cracked vertebrae), the lingering results of which she lived with every day without constant mention of the chronic pain.  In contrast, the pain that began on March 6 was excruciating, incapacitating, and resulted in her barely being able to walk and was, therefore, new, noteworthy, different and unusual.  3/08/21 - Visit #1 to the ER  for excruciating pain. - Pelvic x-ray done, nothing broken; IV morphine given. - Examination by ER physician. - Released from hospital; sent home with script for Norco for pain; did not take because it made her unable to function.  Note:   (Mom) identified the source of her excruciating pain to the ER physician as being in her lower left back region, just at the top of her left pelvic bone, as witnessed by a family member.   3/22/21 - Visit #2 to the ER  Hospital for same excruciating pain (as March 8) and ultimately admitted. - EKG, CT scan, MRI spine, MRI pelvis and whole-body bone scan done during length of stay.  No new findings, only evidence of old fractures and spondylolisthesis, all of which were known, old diagnoses.  3/23/21 - Examination by PA-C for Chief of Orthopedics and subsequently by Hospital.  Note:  Despite the fact that this was the second admission in three weeks for the same pain that was originating from the same source, the orthopedic specialists focused on old compression fractures, old pelvic fractures, and degenerative spinal changes, which (Mom) lived with every day with little complaint.  The source of the excruciating pain that began on March 6, and that was reported on March 8 in the ER, appeared to have been excluded from consideration or discussion.  3/26/21 - Released from hospital with short course of steroids for pain; minute reduction in pain until steroid dose was weaned and the same excruciating pain, that began on March 6, immediately emerged again.  4/7/21   - Visit #3 to the ER  for same excruciating pain (as March 8) and ultimately admitted. - Lumbar/AP spine and dorsal/thoracic spine x-rays, front pelvic & 2 view left hip x-rays, front chest & 3 bilateral rib x-rays, EKG, Echo done during length of stay. - Examination by Hospitalist Internal Medicine.   - Examination by Orthopedic Surgeon.   - Examination by Pain Management Specialist/Neurologist.  4/10/21 - (Mom's) acute inflammation and excruciating pain were diagnosed as Trochanteric Bursitis.  A Depo-Medrol steroid shot was given in left hip area by Pain Management Specialist/Neurologist for the acute inflammation and pain (Mom) had been experiencing for the five weeks since the second Covid-19 shot; pain relief within hours after the steroid shot.  By the end of the day, she went from not being able to walk to walking to the end of the hallway within the hospital.   4/13/21 -  (Mom) was to be transferred Hospital  for rehab program, however, due to spontaneous bleeding of her fistula, she was kept at Hospital for observation.  (Mom's) Vascular Surgeon was called in to help stop the bleeding.    Note:  The spontaneous bleeding from (Mom's) fistula seemed highly unusual as it had never occurred in six years of receiving dialysis.    4/15/21 - Fistulogram performed by Vascular & Interventional Radiology Specialist to ensure fistula was in good working order.  Results showed no stenosis.                  4/16/21 - Transferred to Hospital  for inpatient physical therapy rehab program.  4/23/21 - Released from hospital after successful completion of the rehab program. (Mom) had a positive frame of mind and was looking forward to future plans.  She was able to walk again with the aid of her walker and to function independently; in-home therapy began 4/29 to build up strength she had lost during the 5 weeks of excruciating pain and time spent in the hospital.  5/2/21 -  Spontaneous bleeding from fistula, no blood pressure, heart stopped.  Cause of death ruled (spontaneous) bleeding from fistula.  \n",

She died on April 23rd as a result. Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses & medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine & shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.  Discharge Diagnosis:  Stroke Acute GI Bleeding Acute diastolic heart failure Aortic stenosis Arthritis, on chronic prednisone HTN DM2 Hyperlipidemia, unspecified Urinary tract infection  Surgical Procedures: ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY EGD W/ peg tube 04/14/2021 14:21 placement  Hospital Course: Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history of prior ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysm w/p coiling, as well as HTN and DM2, who presented from an outside facility due to new stroke.  The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.  \n",

Timeline of events from March 4 - May 2, 2021  Note:  (Mom) had a very high tolerance for pain, evidenced by previous major falls &amp; fractured bones (pelvis, hip, both femurs, 9 ribs, 3 cracked vertebrae), the lingering results of which she lived with every day without constant mention of the chronic pain.  In contrast, the pain that began on March 6 was excruciating, incapacitating, and resulted in her barely being able to walk and was, therefore, new, noteworthy, different and unusual.  3/08/21 - Visit #1 to the ER  for excruciating pain. - Pelvic x-ray done, nothing broken; IV morphine given. - Examination by ER physician. - Released from hospital; sent home with script for Norco for pain; did not take because it made her unable to function.  Note:   (Mom) identified the source of her excruciating pain to the ER physician as being in her lower left back region, just at the top of her left pelvic bone, as witnessed by a family member.   3/22/21 - Visit #2 to the ER  Hospital for same excruciating pain (as March 8) and ultimately admitted. - EKG, CT scan, MRI spine, MRI pelvis and whole-body bone scan done during length of stay.  No new findings, only evidence of old fractures and spondylolisthesis, all of which were known, old diagnoses.  3/23/21 - Examination by PA-C for Chief of Orthopedics and subsequently by Hospital.  Note:  Despite the fact that this was the second admission in three weeks for the same pain that was originating from the same source, the orthopedic specialists focused on old compression fractures, old pelvic fractures, and degenerative spinal changes, which (Mom) lived with every day with little complaint.  The source of the excruciating pain that began on March 6, and that was reported on March 8 in the ER, appeared to have been excluded from consideration or discussion.  3/26/21 - Released from hospital with short course of steroids for pain; minute reduction in pain until steroid dose was weaned and the same excruciating pain, that began on March 6, immediately emerged again.  4/7/21   - Visit #3 to the ER  for same excruciating pain (as March 8) and ultimately admitted. - Lumbar/AP spine and dorsal/thoracic spine x-rays, front pelvic &amp; 2 view left hip x-rays, front chest &amp; 3 bilateral rib x-rays, EKG, Echo done during length of stay. - Examination by Hospitalist Internal Medicine.   - Examination by Orthopedic Surgeon.   - Examination by Pain Management Specialist/Neurologist.  4/10/21 - (Mom's) acute inflammation and excruciating pain were diagnosed as Trochanteric Bursitis.  A Depo-Medrol steroid shot was given in left hip area by Pain Management Specialist/Neurologist for the acute inflammation and pain (Mom) had been experiencing for the five weeks since the second Covid-19 shot; pain relief within hours after the steroid shot.  By the end of the day, she went from not being able to walk to walking to the end of the hallway within the hospital.   4/13/21 -  (Mom) was to be transferred Hospital  for rehab program, however, due to spontaneous bleeding of her fistula, she was kept at Hospital for observation.  (Mom's) Vascular Surgeon was called in to help stop the bleeding.    Note:  The spontaneous bleeding from (Mom's) fistula seemed highly unusual as it had never occurred in six years of receiving dialysis.    4/15/21 - Fistulogram performed by Vascular &amp; Interventional Radiology Specialist to ensure fistula was in good working order.  Results showed no stenosis.                  4/16/21 - Transferred to Hospital  for inpatient physical therapy rehab program.  4/23/21 - Released from hospital after successful completion of the rehab program. (Mom) had a positive frame of mind and was looking forward to future plans.  She was able to walk again with the aid of her walker and to function independently; in-home therapy began 4/29 to build up strength she had lost during the 5 weeks of excruciating pain and time spent in the hospital.  5/2/21 -  Spontaneous bleeding from fistula, no blood pressure, heart stopped.  Cause of death ruled (spontaneous) bleeding from fistula.</td>\n",

She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.  Her ischemic stroke was otherwise managed with Plavix and a statin.</td>\n",
