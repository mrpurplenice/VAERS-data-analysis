Analyzing VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) Data

VAERS is the United States early warning system that monitors the safety of vaccines after they are authorized or licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS is part of the larger vaccine safety system in the United States that helps make sure vaccines are safe. The system is co-managed by CDC and FDA. VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences therefore this could lead to an undereporting of symptoms as people are more likely to report serious adverse events than non-serious events. 

This repo was created to analyse the reports of vaccine injuries since 2020, which can be downloaded from the VAERS download page.

As you can see there is a clear jump in the size of data received in 2021 compared to the years 2020 and 2019 in which it was the first year that COVID vaccines were introduced to combat the spread of the Corona Virus.
